<p><br>
A focus group is a type of qualitative research that involves gathering a small group of people together to discuss a particular topic. The goal of a focus group is to get insights into the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of the participants on the topic.</p>
<p>Focus groups are often used in marketing research to get feedback on new products or services. They can also be used in other fields, such as education, healthcare, and social sciences.</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of using focus groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They can provide valuable insights into the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of a target audience.</p></li>
<li><p>They can be used to generate new ideas and concepts.</p></li>
<li><p>They can be used to test hypotheses and assumptions.</p></li>
<li><p>They can be used to get feedback on products, services, and marketing campaigns.</p></li>
<li><p>They can be used to build relationships with stakeholders.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of the limitations of using focus groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They can be time-consuming and expensive to conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>They can be difficult to recruit participants who are representative of the target audience.</p></li>
