</h2>
<p>The history of research ethics in social science is a long and complex one. It has been shaped by a number of factors, including the development of new research methods, the rise of social movements, and public awareness of ethical violations.</p>
<p>In the early days of social science research, there were few formal ethical guidelines. Researchers often conducted their studies without any regard for the rights or welfare of their participants. This led to a number of high-profile ethical violations, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the Milgram Experiments.</p>
<p>These ethical violations led to a growing awareness of the need for ethical standards in social science research. In 1974, the U.S. Congress passed the National Research Act, which established the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. This commission was tasked with developing ethical guidelines for social science research.</p>
<p>The commission’s report, “The Belmont Report,” outlined three basic ethical principles for social science research: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. These principles have been widely adopted by social scientists and have helped to shape the ethical landscape of social science research.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on the need for cultural sensitivity in social science research. This is due in part to the increasing diversity of the world’s population and the growing awareness of the ways in which culture can shape research findings.</p>
<p>As a result of these developments, the field of research ethics in social science is constantly evolving. New ethical challenges are emerging all the time, and researchers must be prepared to adapt their practices accordingly.</p>

<h4>The Tuskegee Syphilis Study<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-tuskegee-syphilis-study"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>This study, which ran from 1932 to 1972, involved 600 African American men who were infected with syphilis but not treated. The researchers observed the men’s progression of the disease without providing them with treatment, even after penicillin became available. This study was unethical because it violated the men’s right to informed consent and because it exposed them to unnecessary harm.</p>

<div id="the-milgram-experiments" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>The Milgram Experiments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-milgram-experiments"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>These experiments, which were conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s, investigated obedience to authority. In the experiments, participants were told to deliver electric shocks to another person, who was actually an actor. The shocks were fake, but the participants did not know this. Many of the participants continued to deliver shocks even when the actor was begging them to stop. This study was unethical because it caused psychological distress to the participants.</p>

<h4>The Stanford Prison Experiment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-stanford-prison-experiment"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>This experiment, which was conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971, simulated a prison environment. Participants were randomly assigned to be either guards or prisoners. The guards quickly began to abuse the prisoners, and the prisoners became increasingly submissive. This study was unethical because it created a stressful and potentially harmful environment for the participants. These are just a few examples of unethical applications of social science research. These studies have helped to raise awareness of the importance of ethical research practices, and they have led to the development of ethical guidelines for social science research.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Key Components<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#key-components"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>There are several key components of ethical research. These include informed consent, confidentiality, debriefing, avoidance of harm, and justice. Each must be present for ethical research.</p>
<div id="informed-consent" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Informed Consent<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#informed-consent"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Participants must be given adequate information about the research in order to make an informed decision about whether or not to participate. This information should include title of project, names of researchers, contact info for researchers, purpose of study, procedures, risks &amp; benefits, and anonymity, voluntary participation.</p>
</div>
<div id="confidentiality" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Confidentiality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#confidentiality"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The privacy of participants must be protected. This means that researchers must not share personal information about participants without their consent.</p>
</div>
<div id="debriefing" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Debriefing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#debriefing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Participants must be debriefed after the research is completed. This means that they must be given more information about the research, including any deception that was used. Participants also have the right to ask questions and to have their concerns addressed.</p>
</div>
<div id="avoidance-of-harm" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Avoidance of Harm<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#avoidance-of-harm"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Participants must not be harmed by the research. This means that researchers must take steps to minimize the risks of harm to participants.</p>
</div>
<div id="justice" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Justice<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#justice"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The benefits and burdens of research must be distributed fairly. This means that researchers must ensure that all participants have an equal opportunity to benefit from the research, and that no one group is disproportionately burdened by the research.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ethical-considerations" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Ethical Considerations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ethical-considerations"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In addition to these key components, there are a number of other ethical considerations that researchers must take into account. Researchers must carefully consider all of these ethical issues when designing and conducting research. By following ethical principles, researchers can help to ensure that their research is conducted in an ethical manner and that the rights and welfare of participants are protected.</p>
<div id="deception" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Deception<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#deception"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Deception can be used in research to prevent participants from guessing the purpose of the study. However, deception can also harm participants by making them feel misled or violated.</p>
</div>
<div id="risks-to-participants" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Risks to Participants<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#risks-to-participants"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Some research involves risks to participants, such as physical or psychological harm. These risks must be weighed against the potential benefits of the research before participants can consent to participate.</p>
</div>
<div id="vulnerable-populations" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Vulnerable Populations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#vulnerable-populations"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Some populations are more vulnerable to harm from research, such as children, prisoners, and people with disabilities. These populations require special protections in research.</p>
</div>
<div id="intellectual-property" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Intellectual Property<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#intellectual-property"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Researchers must be careful not to violate the intellectual property rights of others, such as by publishing data without permission or using copyrighted materials without permission.</p>
</div>
</div>

<span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Current Ethical Challenges in Social Science Research<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#current-ethical-challenges-in-social-science-research"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The use of new technologies, such as social media and big data, raises new ethical challenges. The need for cultural sensitivity in social science research is becoming increasingly important. The tension between the need for confidentiality and the need to share research findings with the public is a challenge that researchers must grapple with. The increasing commercialization of social science research raises ethical concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest.</p>

<div id="history-of-the-institutional-review-board" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>History of the Institutional Review Board<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#history-of-the-institutional-review-board"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a committee that reviews research involving human subjects to ensure that the research is conducted ethically. IRBs are required by law in the United States and in many other countries.</p>
<p>The history of IRBs can be traced back to the Nuremberg Code, which was adopted in 1949 in response to the atrocities committed by Nazi doctors during World War II. The Nuremberg Code established basic ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including the need for informed consent and the avoidance of unnecessary harm.</p>
<p>In 1964, the Declaration of Helsinki was adopted, providing additional guidance on ethical research practices. The Declaration of Helsinki was revised in 2013 to reflect the changing landscape of biomedical research.</p>
<p>In the United States, the National Research Act of 1974 established the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The commission was tasked with developing ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects. The commission’s report, “The Belmont Report,” outlined three basic ethical principles for research involving human subjects: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.</p>
<p>The Belmont Report has been widely adopted by IRBs and has helped to shape the ethical landscape of research involving human subjects. IRBs are responsible for ensuring that research involving human subjects is conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Belmont Report.</p>
</div>
<div id="purpose-of-the-institutional-review-board" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Purpose of the Institutional Review Board<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#purpose-of-the-institutional-review-board"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The purpose of the IRB is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in research. IRBs do this by reviewing research proposals to ensure that they meet ethical standards. IRBs play an important role in protecting the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in research. By reviewing research proposals and ensuring that research is conducted in accordance with ethical standards, IRBs help to ensure that research is conducted in a responsible and ethical manner.</p>
<p>IRBs review research proposals for a number of factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The risks and benefits of the research</li>
<li>The informed consent process</li>
<li>The protection of confidentiality</li>
<li>The selection of research subjects</li>
</ul>
<p>If an IRB finds that a research proposal does not meet ethical standards, the proposal may be modified or rejected.</p>
</div>
<div id="levels-of-risk" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Levels of Risk<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#levels-of-risk"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The three levels of risk for IRB are:</p>
<div id="exempt" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Exempt<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exempt"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Studies that meet the criteria for exemption from IRB review do not pose more than minimal risk to participants. Examples of exempt studies include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Research using existing data or records that cannot be linked back to individual participants.</p></li>
<li><p>Research involving surveys or interviews that do not ask about sensitive topics.</p></li>
<li><p>Research involving the observation of public behavior.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="expedited" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Expedited<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#expedited"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Studies that involve no more than minimal risk to participants and meet the criteria for expedited review may be reviewed by a single IRB reviewer or a small committee of reviewers. Examples of expedited studies include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Research involving the use of noninvasive procedures, such as blood pressure checks or physical exams.</p></li>
<li><p>Research involving the collection of non-sensitive data, such as demographic information or data about food choices.</p></li>
<li><p>Research involving the use of existing data or records that can be linked back to individual participants, but only if the data is de-identified.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="full" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Full<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#full"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Studies that involve more than minimal risk to participants or do not meet the criteria for exempt or expedited review must be reviewed by the full IRB. Examples of full board studies include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Research involving the use of invasive procedures, such as surgery or blood draws.</p></li>
<li><p>Research involving the collection of sensitive data, such as information about mental health or sexual behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Research involving the use of deception or coercion.</p></li>
