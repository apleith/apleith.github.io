Leith, PhD 2023-09-05 Introduction to Communication and Media Research with R [WIP] By: Alex P. Leith, Ph.D. Updated: 31-August-2023 This is an open-access textbook primarily created for my MC 451 course at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE). I believe that it is important for our media and communication students to learn skills like R to better prepare them for the future of this industry. Because coding is so frustrating to new learners, I hope this book will demystify the R language enough that they can use it to separate themselves in their future career. I also hope to make them more willing to tackle new complex systems on their own to continue to grow into the future of the communication and media fields. This is a living document that will be continually adjusted according to feedback from other scholars and students. The current version of this book is a result of multiple semesters of teaching R to students in the Mass Communications department at SIUE, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. I would like to thank, and apologize to, each student that has trudged their way through this process with me. Your feedback has been greatly appreciated and instructive. I hope that each semester continues to become more approachable to students.

I am Alex P. Leith, an Assistant Professor in the Mass Communications department at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. While a doctoral student at Michigan State University, I fell in love with the flexibility of the R program for data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. My intention with this book is to build an introductory research book for communication and media professionals that are tasked with research. For college students, this text is intended for individuals with either zero or limited research experience. This book is also a practice in applying generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) in writing drafts. Namely, the first draft of this paper is a mix of human and AI writing. As I continue to work on this book, I will clean the text until limited traces of AI remain. I am using AI (e.g., Chat GPT, Google Bard) to identify future uses of these tools that still allow for individual work and learning opportunities. This book also borrows structure from existing research methods books. Images are pulled from royalty-free locations, such as Unsplash and Wikimedia. Communication research systematically studies the processes, antecedents, and consequences of communication. It is a broad field encompassing various topics, from interpersonal to mass communication. Media research is the study of the effects of mass media on society, culture, and individuals. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including the impact of media on news consumption, political attitudes, and consumer behavior. Communication and media researchers use various methods to collect data, including surveys, interviews, focus groups, and experiments. Research Ethics Research ethics is the set of moral principles that guide the conduct of research. It is essential to ensure that research is conducted ethically to protect the rights and welfare of research participants, ensure the validity of research findings, and build public trust in research. Several ethical principles are relevant to research, including respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. In addition to these general ethical principles, there are also specific ethical guidelines for different types of research. Research Papers An academic research paper is a piece of writing that presents the results of original research on a particular topic. It is typically written in a formal style and follows a specific format. Academic research papers are usually published in academic journals or presented at conferences. Research papers are discoverable through search engines available through academic libraries, publishers’ websites, and search engines (e.g., Google Scholar). Communication Theories Communication and media theories are a set of concepts and frameworks that help us understand how people communicate and how the media influences our lives. These theories can be used to analyze a wide range of communication phenomena, from interpersonal communication to mass media. Each theory offers a different perspective on how communication and the media work. By understanding these theories, we can better understand how people communicate and how the media influences our lives. Interviews Interviews are a research method in which the interviewer gathers information from the interviewee through open-ended questions and follow-up questions. The goal of a qualitative interview is to understand the interviewee’s experiences, perspectives, and beliefs on a particular topic. Qualitative interviews are often used in social science research, but they can also be used in other fields, such as business, healthcare, and education. They are a valuable tool for gathering in-depth information that cannot be easily obtained through other methods, such as surveys or questionnaires. Interviews can be a valuable tool for researchers who want to understand the experiences, perspectives, and beliefs of people on a particular topic. However, it is important to note that qualitative interviews are not without their challenges. They can be time-consuming and expensive to conduct, and the data can be difficult to analyze. Additionally, the interviewer’s own biases can influence the results of the interview. Focus Groups Focus groups are a research method in which a group of people are brought together to discuss a particular topic. The facilitator of the focus group asks open-ended questions and encourages the participants to share their thoughts and experiences. The goal of a focus group is to get a variety of perspectives on a particular topic and to understand how people interact with each other and with the topic. Focus groups can be a valuable tool for researchers who want to understand the perspectives of a group of people on a particular topic. However, it is important to note that qualitative focus groups are not without their challenges. They can be time-consuming and expensive to conduct, and the data can be difficult to analyze. Additionally, the facilitator’s own biases can influence the results of the focus group. Ethnography Ethnography is a research method that involves immersing the researcher in a particular culture or community to study its social interactions, behaviors, and beliefs. The researcher typically conducts participant observation, interviews, and document analysis to gather data. The goal of qualitative ethnography is to gain a deep understanding of the culture or community from the insider’s perspective. Ethnography can be a valuable tool for researchers who want to understand the culture or community of a particular group of people. However, it is important to note that qualitative ethnography is not without its challenges. It can be time-consuming and expensive to conduct, and the researcher’s own biases can influence the results of the study. Qualitative Content Analysis Qualitative content analysis is a research method for the subjective interpretation of the content of text data through the systematic classification process of coding and identifying themes or patterns. The goal of qualitative content analysis is to understand the meaning of the text data by identifying patterns and themes. Qualitative content analysis can be a valuable tool for researchers who want to understand the meaning of text data. However, it is important to note that qualitative content analysis is not without its challenges. It can be time-consuming and labor-intensive to conduct, and the researcher’s own biases can influence the results of the analysis. Quantitative Content Analysis Quantitative content analysis is a research method for the objective, systematic, and quantitative description of the content of text data. The goal of quantitative content analysis is to quantify the presence of certain words, phrases, or concepts in a text and to analyze the relationships between these features. Quantitative content analysis can be a valuable tool for researchers who want to quantify the presence of certain words, phrases, or concepts in a text. However, it is important to note that quantitative content analysis is not without its challenges. It can be time-consuming and labor-intensive to conduct, and the researcher’s own biases can still influence the results of the analysis. Surveys Surveys are a research method in which a researcher asks a set of questions to a group of people in order to collect numerical data. The data is then analyzed to answer research questions or test hypotheses. Surveys can be a valuable tool for researchers who want to collect data about a large group of people. However, it is important to note that quantitative surveys are not without their challenges. They can be time-consuming and expensive to conduct, and the respondents may not always answer the questions honestly or accurately. Experiment Experiment are research studies that use a scientific approach to test a hypothesis. The researcher manipulates one or more variables and then measures the effects of the manipulation on one or more other variables. Experiment can be a valuable tool for researchers who want to test a hypothesis and to determine the cause and effect relationship between two or more variables. However, it is important to note that quantitative experiments are not without their challenges. They can be time-consuming and expensive to conduct, and the results can be affected by the way the experiment is conducted. Introduction to R R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a free and open-source software environment, making it available to everyone to use and modify. R is used by statisticians, data miners, and researchers in various fields. The program allows individuals to use code to expedite data cleaning and analysis tasks. Users are also provided with a range of options for data visualization. Working with Data Data is a collection of facts, figures, or observations that can be used to answer questions or test hypotheses. Data can be collected from various sources, including surveys, experiments, and observations. Once data has been collected, it needs to be prepared for analysis. This process typically involves cleaning the data, formatting the data, and transforming the data. Researchers can either use R for these stages or external programs (e.g., Excel). Visuals There are many different types of data visualization, each with strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most common types of data visualization include bar charts, scatter plots, images, or tables. The best kind of data visualization for a particular dataset depends on the specific research question and the study’s goals. Choosing a data visualization that is easy to understand and accurately represents the data is essential. Analyses Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, inform conclusions, and support decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under various names in different business, science, and social science domains. For our context, we are most interested in descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize data and describe its main features. They can be used to calculate measures of central tendency (such as the mean, median, and mode) and measures of variation (such as the standard deviation). Inferential statistics are used to make inferences about a population based on a sample. They can be used to test hypotheses and estimate parameters. The best type of data analysis for a particular dataset will depend on the specific research question being asked and the goals of the study. Choosing a data analysis method that is appropriate for the data and will help answer the research question is vital.

It has been shaped by a number of factors, including the development of new research methods, the rise of social movements, and public awareness of ethical violations. In the early days of social science research, there were few formal ethical guidelines. Researchers often conducted their studies without any regard for the rights or welfare of their participants. This led to a number of high-profile ethical violations, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the Milgram Experiments. These ethical violations led to a growing awareness of the need for ethical standards in social science research. In 1974, the U.S. Congress passed the National Research Act, which established the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. This commission was tasked with developing ethical guidelines for social science research. The commission’s report, “The Belmont Report,” outlined three basic ethical principles for social science research: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. These principles have been widely adopted by social scientists and have helped to shape the ethical landscape of social science research. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on the need for cultural sensitivity in social science research. This is due in part to the increasing diversity of the world’s population and the growing awareness of the ways in which culture can shape research findings. As a result of these developments, the field of research ethics in social science is constantly evolving. New ethical challenges are emerging all the time, and researchers must be prepared to adapt their practices accordingly. Key Events 1949: The Nuremberg Code is adopted, outlining ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects. 1964: The Declaration of Helsinki is adopted, providing recommendations for biomedical research involving human subjects. 1974: The National Research Act is passed, establishing the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. 1979: The Belmont Report is published, outlining three basic ethical principles for social science research: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. 1991: The American Psychological Association adopts its first code of ethics for research with human participants. 2002: The National Bioethics Advisory Commission issues its report, “Ethical and Policy Issues in Human Stem Cell Research,” which discusses the ethical implications of stem cell research. 2013: The American Sociological Association adopts its first code of ethics for research with human participants. Unethical Research The Tuskegee Syphilis Study This study, which ran from 1932 to 1972, involved 600 African American men who were infected with syphilis but not treated. The researchers observed the men’s progression of the disease without providing them with treatment, even after penicillin became available. This study was unethical because it violated the men’s right to informed consent and because it exposed them to unnecessary harm. The Milgram Experiments These experiments, which were conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s, investigated obedience to authority. In the experiments, participants were told to deliver electric shocks to another person, who was actually an actor. The shocks were fake, but the participants did not know this. Many of the participants continued to deliver shocks even when the actor was begging them to stop. This study was unethical because it caused psychological distress to the participants. The Stanford Prison Experiment This experiment, which was conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971, simulated a prison environment. Participants were randomly assigned to be either guards or prisoners. The guards quickly began to abuse the prisoners, and the prisoners became increasingly submissive. This study was unethical because it created a stressful and potentially harmful environment for the participants. These are just a few examples of unethical applications of social science research. These studies have helped to raise awareness of the importance of ethical research practices, and they have led to the development of ethical guidelines for social science research. Key Components There are several key components of ethical research. These include informed consent, confidentiality, debriefing, avoidance of harm, and justice. Each must be present for ethical research. Informed Consent Participants must be given adequate information about the research in order to make an informed decision about whether or not to participate. This information should include title of project, names of researchers, contact info for researchers, purpose of study, procedures, risks &amp; benefits, and anonymity, voluntary participation. Confidentiality The privacy of participants must be protected. This means that researchers must not share personal information about participants without their consent. Debriefing Participants must be debriefed after the research is completed. This means that they must be given more information about the research, including any deception that was used. Participants also have the right to ask questions and to have their concerns addressed. Avoidance of Harm Participants must not be harmed by the research. This means that researchers must take steps to minimize the risks of harm to participants. Justice The benefits and burdens of research must be distributed fairly. This means that researchers must ensure that all participants have an equal opportunity to benefit from the research, and that no one group is disproportionately burdened by the research. Ethical Considerations In addition to these key components, there are a number of other ethical considerations that researchers must take into account. Researchers must carefully consider all of these ethical issues when designing and conducting research. By following ethical principles, researchers can help to ensure that their research is conducted in an ethical manner and that the rights and welfare of participants are protected. Deception Deception can be used in research to prevent participants from guessing the purpose of the study. However, deception can also harm participants by making them feel misled or violated. Risks to Participants Some research involves risks to participants, such as physical or psychological harm. These risks must be weighed against the potential benefits of the research before participants can consent to participate. Vulnerable Populations Some populations are more vulnerable to harm from research, such as children, prisoners, and people with disabilities. These populations require special protections in research. Intellectual Property Researchers must be careful not to violate the intellectual property rights of others, such as by publishing data without permission or using copyrighted materials without permission. 2.2 Current Ethical Challenges in Social Science Research The use of new technologies, such as social media and big data, raises new ethical challenges. The need for cultural sensitivity in social science research is becoming increasingly important. The tension between the need for confidentiality and the need to share research findings with the public is a challenge that researchers must grapple with. The increasing commercialization of social science research raises ethical concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest. 2.3 Institutional Review Board History of the Institutional Review Board The Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a committee that reviews research involving human subjects to ensure that the research is conducted ethically. IRBs are required by law in the United States and in many other countries. The history of IRBs can be traced back to the Nuremberg Code, which was adopted in 1949 in response to the atrocities committed by Nazi doctors during World War II. The Nuremberg Code established basic ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including the need for informed consent and the avoidance of unnecessary harm. In 1964, the Declaration of Helsinki was adopted, providing additional guidance on ethical research practices. The Declaration of Helsinki was revised in 2013 to reflect the changing landscape of biomedical research. In the United States, the National Research Act of 1974 established the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The commission was tasked with developing ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects. The commission’s report, “The Belmont Report,” outlined three basic ethical principles for research involving human subjects: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. The Belmont Report has been widely adopted by IRBs and has helped to shape the ethical landscape of research involving human subjects. IRBs are responsible for ensuring that research involving human subjects is conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Belmont Report. Purpose of the Institutional Review Board The purpose of the IRB is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in research. IRBs do this by reviewing research proposals to ensure that they meet ethical standards. IRBs play an important role in protecting the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in research. By reviewing research proposals and ensuring that research is conducted in accordance with ethical standards, IRBs help to ensure that research is conducted in a responsible and ethical manner. IRBs review research proposals for a number of factors, including: The risks and benefits of the research The informed consent process The protection of confidentiality The selection of research subjects If an IRB finds that a research proposal does not meet ethical standards, the proposal may be modified or rejected. Levels of Risk The three levels of risk for IRB are: Exempt Studies that meet the criteria for exemption from IRB review do not pose more than minimal risk to participants. Examples of exempt studies include: Research using existing data or records that cannot be linked back to individual participants. Research involving surveys or interviews that do not ask about sensitive topics. Research involving the observation of public behavior. Expedited Studies that involve no more than minimal risk to participants and meet the criteria for expedited review may be reviewed by a single IRB reviewer or a small committee of reviewers. Examples of expedited studies include: Research involving the use of noninvasive procedures, such as blood pressure checks or physical exams. Research involving the collection of non-sensitive data, such as demographic information or data about food choices. Research involving the use of existing data or records that can be linked back to individual participants, but only if the data is de-identified. Full Studies that involve more than minimal risk to participants or do not meet the criteria for exempt or expedited review must be reviewed by the full IRB. Examples of full board studies include: Research involving the use of invasive procedures, such as surgery or blood draws. Research involving the collection of sensitive data, such as information about mental health or sexual behavior. Research involving the use of deception or coercion. 2.4 References American Psychological Association (2017). Ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct.

Here are a few popular methods: Use a specialized search engine. Specialized search engines are designed to search for specific types of information, such as research articles. Here are some tips on how to use a specialized search engine to find research articles: Choose the right search engine. There are many specialized search engines available, so it is important to choose one that is relevant to your topic. Some popular specialized search engines for research articles include: Google Scholar PubMed Web of Science Scopus IEEE Xplore ACM Digital Library Use keywords. When you are searching for research articles, it is important to use keywords that are relevant to your topic. You can use the same keywords that you would use for a general search engine, but you may also need to use more specific keywords. Use advanced search features. Most specialized search engines have advanced search features that allow you to narrow down your search results. For example, you can specify the publication date, the language, or the type of document. Read the results carefully. Once you have found some research articles, take some time to read them carefully. This will help you identify the articles that are most relevant to your research. Evaluate the quality of the sources. Not all sources are created equal. When you are evaluating the quality of a research article, consider the following factors: The author’s credentials The publication date The journal’s reputation The methodology used The findings of the study By following these tips, you can use a specialized search engine to find research articles that are relevant to your topic and of high quality. Here are some additional tips for using a specialized search engine to find research articles: Use quotation marks to search for exact phrases. For example, if you are looking for articles about the “impact of social media on mental health,” you would search for “impact of social media on mental health.” Use Boolean operators to combine keywords. Boolean operators, such as AND, OR, and NOT, can be used to combine keywords and narrow down your search results. For example, if you are looking for articles about the “impact of social media on mental health” in the journal “Nature,” you would search for “impact of social media AND mental health AND Nature.” Use filters to narrow down your results. Most specialized search engines allow you to filter your results by publication date, language, and other criteria. This can be helpful if you are looking for specific types of research articles. Use the search engine’s help documentation. Most specialized search engines have help documentation that can provide you with more information about how to use the search engine. I hope these tips help you find the research articles you are looking for. Check your university library. Your university library has a wealth of resources that you can use to find research articles. Here are some tips on how to use your university library to find research articles: Talk to a librarian. Librarians are experts in finding information. They can help you choose the right databases and search strategies for your research. Use the library’s online catalog. The library’s online catalog is a searchable database of all the books, journals, and other materials that the library owns. Use the library’s databases. The library subscribes to a variety of databases that contain research articles. These databases can be searched by keyword, author, or subject. Ask for help from a research assistant. Many libraries have research assistants who can help you find research articles. Search for preprints. A research preprint is a preliminary version of a research paper that is made available online before it has been peer-reviewed and published in a journal. Preprints are often used by researchers to share their work with the wider community and to get feedback on their findings. Preprints can be a valuable resource for researchers, as they can provide access to the latest research findings before they are published. They can also help researchers to get feedback on their work and to collaborate with other researchers. However, it is important to keep in mind that preprints have not been peer-reviewed and may contain errors. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the quality of the preprint carefully before citing it in your own research. Here are some of the advantages of using preprints: Faster dissemination of research findings. Preprints can be made available online much faster than traditional journal articles, which can take months or even years to publish. This allows researchers to share their work with the wider community more quickly and to get feedback on their findings. Increased collaboration. Preprints can be a valuable tool for collaboration, as they allow researchers to share their work with other researchers before it has been published. This can help to identify potential errors and to improve the quality of the research. Reduced publication bias. Preprints can help to reduce publication bias, which is the tendency for journals to publish research that supports the authors’ hypothesis. This is because preprints are not subject to the same peer-review process as journal articles, and therefore, they are more likely to be published regardless of the findings. Here are some of the disadvantages of using preprints: Unreviewed research. Preprints have not been peer-reviewed, which means that they may contain errors. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the quality of the preprint carefully before citing it in your own research. Potential for plagiarism. Preprints are publicly available, which means that there is a potential for plagiarism. Therefore, it is important to give credit to the original authors of the research when you cite a preprint. Legal issues. There are a number of legal issues that can arise with the use of preprints. For example, it is important to make sure that you have the right to share the preprint and that you are not violating the authors’ copyright. Search preprint repositories. There are a number of preprint repositories that you can search, such as: arXiv bioRxiv medRxiv PeerJ Preprints PsyArXiv SocArXiv Use specialized search engines. There are also a number of specialized search engines that can be used to find preprints, such as: Preprints.org ASAPbio PreLights Publons When using preprints, it is important to keep in mind that they have not been peer-reviewed and may contain errors. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the quality of the preprint carefully before citing it in your own research. Here are some things to consider when evaluating a preprint: The author’s credentials The methodology used The findings of the study The potential for bias Use social media. You can use social media to find research articles in a few different ways: Follow researchers and research institutions. Many researchers and research institutions use social media to share their work, including research articles. By following these accounts, you can stay up-to-date on the latest research in your field. Use relevant hashtags. Hashtags are a great way to find research articles on social media. When you search for a relevant hashtag, you will see all the posts that have been tagged with that hashtag. This can be a great way to find research articles that you might not have otherwise found. Join research groups and communities. There are many research groups and communities on social media where researchers can share their work and discuss research topics. By joining these groups, you can connect with other researchers and find research articles that are relevant to your interests. Attend online conferences and workshops. Many conferences and workshops are now being held online, and these can be a great way to find research articles. Often, the presentations from these events are posted online, and you can also interact with the speakers and other attendees. Here are some specific social media platforms that you can use to find research articles: Twitter: Twitter is a great platform for following researchers and research institutions. You can also use Twitter to search for research articles using hashtags.

Be sure to also thank the expert for their time and consideration. 3.2 How to Read Research Papers There are many different approaches to reading a research paper, but these are some of the most effective ones. The three-pass approach. The three-pass approach to reading a research paper is a method of reading a paper in three stages, each with a specific goal. The first pass. This is a quick scan to capture a high-level view of the paper. You should read the title, abstract, and introduction carefully, and then skim the rest of the paper, paying attention to the headings and subheadings. The goal of this pass is to get a general understanding of what the paper is about, its main points, and its contributions to the field. The second pass: This is a more detailed reading of the paper. You should read the introduction and conclusion carefully, and then read the rest of the paper in more detail, paying attention to the methods, results, and discussion. The goal of this pass is to understand the paper’s arguments and evidence, and to assess its strengths and weaknesses. The third pass: This is a critical reading of the paper. You should read the paper carefully, taking notes and challenging the author’s assumptions and conclusions. The goal of this pass is to fully understand the paper and to be able to critically evaluate its claims. The question-based approach. The question-based approach to reading a research paper is a method of reading a paper by asking questions about the paper as you read. This approach can help you to focus your reading and to ensure that you understand the key points of the paper. Here are some questions that you can ask yourself as you read a research paper: What is the purpose of the paper? What are the main questions that the paper addresses? What are the key findings of the paper? How does the paper contribute to the existing body of knowledge? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper? How does the paper relate to my own research interests? You can also ask more specific questions that are relevant to the specific paper that you are reading. For example, if you are reading a paper about a new medical treatment, you might ask questions about the safety and effectiveness of the treatment. The question-based approach can be used in conjunction with the three-pass approach to reading a research paper. In the first pass, you can ask general questions about the paper to get a sense of what it is about. In the second pass, you can ask more specific questions to understand the paper in more detail. In the third pass, you can critically evaluate the paper by asking questions about its methods, findings, and conclusions. The question-based approach is a flexible method that can be adapted to your own needs and preferences. By asking questions as you read, you can improve your understanding of research papers and your ability to critically evaluate their claims. The question-based approach is a valuable tool for reading and understanding research papers. By asking questions as you read, you can improve your comprehension and critical thinking skills. The active reading approach. Active reading is a method of reading that involves engaging with the text in a thoughtful and critical way. It is different from passive reading, which is simply reading the text without thinking about it. Active reading can be used to read any type of text, but it is especially important for reading research papers. Research papers are often dense and technical, so it is important to be actively engaged in order to understand them. Here are some tips for active reading: Ask questions: As you read, ask yourself questions about the text. What is the author’s purpose? What are the main points? What evidence does the author provide to support their claims? Take notes: Taking notes can help you to remember the key points of the text and to track your progress. You can take notes in the margins of the text, or you can use a separate notebook. Summarize: After each section of the text, summarize the key points in your own words. This will help you to solidify your understanding of the text. Discuss the text with others: Talking to others about a text can help you to gain new insights and perspectives. Annotate the text: Annotating the text means making notes and comments in the margins. This can help you to highlight important passages, ask questions, and make connections between different parts of the text. Use a highlighter: Highlighting important passages can help you to focus your attention and to remember the key points of the text. Take a break: Don’t try to read a research paper in one sitting. Take breaks to refresh your mind and to come back to the text with fresh eyes. Active reading takes time and effort, but it is a valuable skill for anyone who wants to learn and grow. By actively reading research papers, you can improve your comprehension, critical thinking skills, and ability to learn new things. The collaborative reading approach. This approach involves reading the paper with a partner or group of people. This can be helpful for getting different perspectives on the paper and for identifying areas where you need clarification. No matter which approach you choose, it is important to take your time and read the paper carefully. Research papers can be dense and challenging, but they can also be very rewarding. By taking the time to read them carefully, you can learn a lot about your field and contribute to the advancement of knowledge. The question-based approach is a valuable tool for reading and understanding research papers. By asking questions as you read, you can improve your comprehension and critical thinking skills. 3.3 How to Write Research Papers There are many different approaches to writing a research paper, but some of the most effective ones include: Choose an interesting topic you know. This is the most important factor, as you will be spending a lot of time researching and writing about your topic. If you are not interested in the topic, it will be difficult to stay motivated. You should also make sure your topic is relevant to your field of study or to your career goals. This will make it easier to find sources and to write a research paper that is valuable to others. Don’t choose a topic that is too broad or too narrow. A good research topic should be specific enough to be manageable, but broad enough to allow for some exploration. I also recommend that you choose a topic that has been studied before. This will make it easier to find sources and to get started on your research. However, you can also choose a topic that is new or emerging, as long as you are prepared to do the necessary research. If you find it difficult finding a topic, you can talk to an expert, such as a professor or independent researcher. They can help you choose a research topic that is appropriate for your level of study and that meets the requirements of your assignment. One approach you can take is brainstorming a list of potential topics. Write down any topics that you are interested in or that you think would be interesting to research. You may also need to do some preliminary research. Once you have a list of potential topics, do some preliminary research to see how much information is available. You can use online databases, library catalogs, and search engines to find relevant sources. If you already chose a topic but you are having a hard time making progress, do not be afraid to change your topic. It is perfectly normal to change your research topic as you learn more about the subject. If you find that your original topic is not as interesting or manageable as you thought, don’t be afraid to change it. For this purpose, I recommend starting your project early enough to make a change. You should also know that you do not need to make a full topic change. A minor change may suffice. Do your research thoroughly. Read as many relevant research papers as you can and take good notes. This will help you to develop a strong understanding of the topic and to form your own arguments. It will help if you use a variety of sources. Don’t rely on just one or two sources. Look for information from a variety of sources, including books, articles, websites, and interviews. When choosing between different sources, evaluate your sources critically. Not all sources are created equal. Be sure to evaluate the quality of your sources before you use them. Consider the author’s credentials, the purpose of the source, and the date of publication. While you are collecting and verifying these sources, take notes carefully. As you gather information, be sure to take careful notes. This will help you keep track of your sources and the information you have found. All the collected information must be synthesized. Once you have gathered a lot of information, it’s time to synthesize it. This means putting the information together to form a coherent argument. This stage of the research is not always easy. I recommend that you be patient. It takes time to do thorough research. Don’t expect to find all the answers overnight. It is also necessary to be persistent. Don’t give up if you don’t find the information you’re looking for right away. Keep searching until you find what you need. Write a clear and concise thesis statement. A thesis statement is a sentence that summarizes the main point of your essay. It should be clear, concise, and arguable. You must first start with a strong research question. What do you want to learn about? What are you trying to prove or disprove? Next, narrow down your focus. Don’t try to cover too much ground in your essay. Focus on one specific aspect of your research question. Once you have narrowed down your focus, further refine it so that you can state your main point clearly. What is the one thing you want your readers to take away from your essay? Your newly created thesis statement must be arguable. Your thesis statement should be a claim that can be supported with evidence from your research. Finally, it must be concise. Your thesis statement should be one or two sentences long. Here is an example of a clear and concise thesis statement: The rise of social media has led to an increase in cyberbullying among teenagers. This thesis statement is clear because it states the main point of the essay in a concise and direct way. It is also arguable because it is a claim that can be supported with evidence from research. Here is an example of a thesis statement that is not clear: Social media has had a big impact on teenagers. This thesis statement is not clear because it does not state the main point of the essay in a specific way. It also does not make a claim that can be supported with evidence. Here is an example of a thesis statement that is not concise: The rise of social media has had a profound impact on the lives of teenagers, both positive and negative. It has led to an increase in communication and social interaction, but it has also led to an increase in cyberbullying and other forms of online harassment. This thesis statement is not concise because it is too long and wordy. It could be improved by making it more specific and by narrowing down the focus. Organize your paper carefully. Organizing your paper carefully is essential for writing a clear and concise paper that is easy to read and understand. The best place to start is with an outline. An outline will help you organize your thoughts and ideas before you start writing. It will also help you make sure that your paper has a logical flow. You should use headings and subheadings in your outline that can be easily transferred to your full paper. Headings and subheadings will help your readers quickly scan your paper and find the information they are looking for. When fleshing out your outline, you should use transition words and phrases. Transition words and phrases will help your readers follow your train of thought and make sure that your paper flows smoothly. Before you submit your paper, proofread it carefully. Before you submit your paper, proofread it carefully for any errors in grammar, spelling, or punctuation. If you have a thesis statement already, but are having a hard time starting with your outline or writing, you can start by brainstorming your main points. What are the main points you want to make in your paper? Once you have a list of your main points, you can start to organize them into an outline. Your main points should then be presented in a logical order. When you are organizing your paper, it is important to use a logical order. This means that your main points should flow from one to the next in a logical way. It is not uncommon to revise your outline during that stage, so do not be afraid to revise your outline. As you write your paper, you may need to revise your outline. This is perfectly normal. The outline is just a tool to help you organize your thoughts, and it is not set in stone. At any stage, you can get feedback from others. Once you have a draft of your paper, get feedback from others. This could be your professor, a tutor, or a friend. Feedback from others can help you identify any areas where your paper can be improved. If you are afraid of other people reading your full paper, you can give them pieces of the paper, an early draft, or an outline. By giving them a small, rough portion of the paper, it can make it easier to handle suggestions since you know it is not yet meant to be perfect. Write in a clear and concise style. Writing in a clear and concise style is paramount for a research paper, as it ensures that complex ideas are communicated effectively to the readers. To achieve this, several key strategies should be employed. First, focus on crafting well-structured sentences that convey one main idea each. Avoid excessive use of jargon and technical terms, opting instead for plain language that is easily understandable. Additionally, make use of active voice to enhance readability and directness in your writing. Paragraphs should be organized logically, starting with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main point of the paragraph. Follow this with supporting sentences that provide evidence, examples, or explanations related to the topic. Ensure a smooth flow by using transitional words and phrases to connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs. In terms of length, aim for paragraphs that are neither too short nor too long. A paragraph ideally consists of 3-5 sentences, but this can vary depending on the complexity of the topic and the depth of discussion required. Lastly, edit and revise your writing diligently. Remove any redundant or repetitive information, eliminate unnecessary adjectives or adverbs, and tighten your sentences. Use concise language to express your ideas without sacrificing clarity. By following these guidelines, you can produce a research paper that is both easily comprehensible and intellectually rigorous. Use evidence to support your arguments. Using evidence effectively to support your arguments is crucial for building a strong and convincing case. Start by clearly stating your argument or thesis in a topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph. This sets the stage for what you will be discussing. Next, introduce your evidence in a way that demonstrates its relevance to your argument. This could involve citing credible sources such as academic studies, statistics, expert opinions, or real-world examples. Make sure the evidence is directly related to the point you’re trying to make and supports the overall message of your paper. After introducing the evidence, provide context or explanation to help your readers understand how the evidence supports your argument. Avoid assuming that the significance of the evidence is immediately clear; instead, guide your readers through the connection between the evidence and your argument. This might involve explaining the methodology behind a study, interpreting statistics, or describing the circumstances of a specific example. Once you’ve presented the evidence and its context, analyze it in relation to your argument. Explain why the evidence is relevant and how it reinforces your thesis. Discuss any patterns, trends, or insights that emerge from the evidence. This is the heart of your paragraph, where you demonstrate the logical connection between the evidence and your argument. Conclude the paragraph by summarizing the main points you’ve made and reiterating how the evidence supports your overall argument. This helps reinforce the reader’s understanding of the relationship between the evidence and your thesis. Remember to maintain a balance between the amount of evidence and the amount of analysis. Too much evidence without analysis can make your writing feel disjointed, while too much analysis without evidence can weaken your argument’s credibility. By following this structure, you can effectively integrate evidence to bolster your arguments and enhance the persuasiveness of your research paper. Proofread your paper carefully. Proofreading is an extremely important step in ensuring the quality and accuracy of your research paper. To effectively proofread your work, consider the following tips. Begin by taking a break after completing the initial draft; distancing yourself from the content will allow you to approach the paper with fresh eyes. When you’re ready to proofread, start by checking for grammatical errors, including punctuation and spelling mistakes. Carefully review each sentence to ensure proper subject-verb agreement, consistent verb tenses, and accurate word choices. Pay special attention to sentence structure and clarity. Long, convoluted sentences can confuse readers, so consider breaking them into smaller, more digestible ones. Read your paper aloud to identify awkward phrasing or unclear passages; if it doesn’t sound right when spoken, it might need revision. Check your formatting to ensure consistency throughout the paper. Verify that headings, font styles, spacing, and citations adhere to the required style guide (e.g., APA, MLA). Focus on the flow of your argument. Ensure that each paragraph logically connects to the next, and that your ideas progress in a coherent manner. Check that your transitions are smooth, guiding the reader through your paper seamlessly. Review your in-text citations and reference list to confirm that all sources are properly credited and formatted correctly. Mistakes in citations can harm your paper’s credibility. Consider seeking feedback from peers or mentors. A fresh perspective can reveal issues you might have missed. Proofreading tools like grammar checkers can also be helpful, but use them judiciously, as they may not catch every mistake. Finally, read your paper multiple times, focusing on one aspect (e.g., grammar, clarity, citations) during each read-through. This targeted approach can help you catch different types of errors. Ultimately, thorough proofreading ensures that your research paper is polished, clear, and effectively communicates your ideas to your readers. Additional Tips Here are some additional tips for writing a research paper: Start early. Don’t wait until the last minute to start writing your paper. This will give you enough time to do your research thoroughly and to write a well-organized paper. Get feedback from others. Ask a friend, family member, or professor to read your paper and give you feedback. This can help you to identify areas where your paper can be improved. Don’t be afraid to revise. It is important to revise your paper multiple times before you submit it. This will help you to improve your writing style and to make sure that your paper is error-free. Take breaks. Don’t try to write your paper in one sitting. Take breaks to clear your head and to come back to it with fresh eyes. Academic Examples There are many different ways to report research in academia.

Here are the basic steps on how to cite research papers using APA: In-text citations. In-text citations are used to give credit to the sources you used in your paper. They are placed in parentheses after the information you are citing, and they include the author’s last name, the year of publication, and the page number(s) where the information can be found. For example, if you are citing a quote from a book by John Smith, published in 2023, on page 100, your in-text citation would look like this: (Smith, 2023, p. 100). Reference list. The reference list is a list of all the sources you used in your paper. It is placed at the end of your paper, and it is organized alphabetically by the author’s last name. Each entry in the reference list includes the author’s name, the year of publication, the title of the source, the publication information, and any other relevant information. For example, the reference list entry for the book by John Smith would look like this: Smith, J. (2023). The Psychology of Learning. New York, NY: Oxford University Press. Here is the template for each of the typical types of APA citations. Please review the APA website or Purdue’s Writing Lab (OWL) for additional help with APA 7th. Book. Author, A. A.

The theory suggests that the media does not simply reflect public opinion, but rather shapes it by determining which issues are considered important. This is done by selecting and highlighting certain news stories over others, and by framing those stories in a particular way. The theory was first proposed by Maxwell McCombs and Donald Shaw in their 1972 study of the 1968 US presidential election. They found that the media’s coverage of the election had a significant impact on the public’s perception of the relative importance of the issues. For example, the media focused heavily on the Vietnam War, which led to the public viewing this issue as more important than other issues, such as the economy. Since then, agenda setting theory has been applied to a wide range of issues, including politics, social problems, and consumer products. The theory has been supported by a number of studies, but it is not without its critics. Some argue that the media does not have as much influence on public opinion as the theory suggests, and that other factors, such as personal experience and social interaction, are more important. Despite these criticisms, agenda setting theory remains one of the most influential theories in mass communication. It has helped to explain how the media can shape public opinion, and it has implications for the way we think about the role of the media in society. Levels of agenda setting There are two levels of agenda setting: First-level agenda setting: This level focuses on the media’s ability to influence the salience of issues. Salience refers to the importance or prominence that people attach to an issue. The media can influence salience by selecting and highlighting certain issues over others. Second-level agenda setting: This level focuses on the media’s ability to influence the public’s perception of the attributes of an issue. This includes the causes, consequences, and solutions to the issue. The media can influence the public’s perception of these attributes by the way they frame the issue in their news coverage. Factors affecting agenda setting There are a number of factors that can affect agenda setting, including: The media’s own agenda: The media has its own agenda, which is influenced by a variety of factors, such as the ownership of the media outlet, the political climate, and the economic interests of the media. The public’s agenda: The public also has its own agenda, which is influenced by a variety of factors, such as personal experiences, social interaction, and the media. The political system: The political system can also affect agenda setting by setting the agenda for public debate. The newsworthiness of the issue: The newsworthiness of an issue is also a factor in agenda setting. Issues that are considered to be more newsworthy are more likely to be covered by the media. Conclusion Agenda setting theory is a complex and nuanced theory that has been the subject of much research and debate. However, it remains one of the most important theories in mass communication, and it has helped to explain how the media can shape public opinion. References McCombs, M. E., &amp; Shaw, D. L. (1972).

This discomfort motivates the person to try to reduce the dissonance by changing one of the beliefs, changing their behavior, or finding a way to justify the inconsistency. The theory of cognitive dissonance was first proposed by Leon Festinger in 1957. Festinger argued that people have a need for consistency in their thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors. When this consistency is threatened, people experience cognitive dissonance and are motivated to reduce it. There are a number of ways that people can reduce cognitive dissonance. One way is to change one of the beliefs. For example, if a person believes that smoking is bad for their health, but they continue to smoke, they might start to believe that smoking is not as bad as they thought it was. Another way to reduce cognitive dissonance is to change one’s behavior. For example, if a person believes that they should eat healthy, but they continue to eat unhealthy foods, they might start to eat healthier foods. Finally, people can also reduce cognitive dissonance by finding a way to justify the inconsistency. For example, a smoker might justify their smoking by saying that they enjoy it and that it helps them to relax. Cognitive dissonance is a powerful motivator of human behavior. It can lead people to change their beliefs, their behaviors, or their justifications for their behavior. It can also lead to a number of other consequences, such as anxiety, stress, and depression. Here are some examples of cognitive dissonance: A person who believes in saving money but spends all of their disposable income on unnecessary items. A person who believes in being honest but cheats on their taxes. A person who believes in eating healthy but eats junk food all the time. A person who believes in animal rights but wears leather shoes. These are just a few examples of how cognitive dissonance can manifest itself in our everyday lives. It is important to note that cognitive dissonance is not always negative. In some cases, it can motivate us to change our behavior for the better. For example, a person who experiences cognitive dissonance after smoking a cigarette might be more likely to quit smoking. Cognitive dissonance is a complex phenomenon that has been studied by psychologists for many years. It is a powerful force that can have a significant impact on our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors.

The theory was developed by George Gerbner and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication in the 1960s. Cultivation theory proposes that heavy television viewers come to see the world in a way that is consistent with the images and messages that they are repeatedly exposed to on television. This is because television is a powerful socializing agent that can shape our beliefs, attitudes, and values. The theory has been supported by a number of studies, which have found that heavy television viewers are more likely to overestimate the likelihood of violence, crime, and danger in the world. They are also more likely to have a pessimistic view of human nature and to be fearful of strangers. Cultivation theory has been criticized for being too simplistic and for failing to take into account other factors that can influence our perceptions of reality, such as personal experience and social interaction. However, the theory remains an important framework for understanding the effects of television on our lives. Here are some of the key concepts of cultivation theory: Symbolic environment: The world of television, as presented to viewers. Cultivation effect: The process by which heavy television viewing leads to viewers’ perceptions of reality becoming more consistent with the images and messages presented on television. Mainstreaming: The tendency for heavy television viewers to come to share similar perceptions of reality, regardless of their demographic characteristics. Resonance: The process by which the cultivation effect is stronger for viewers who are already predisposed to believe the messages that are presented on television. Cultivation theory has been applied to a wide range of topics, including violence, crime, fear, gender roles, and political attitudes. The theory has also been used to examine the effects of other media, such as the internet and video games. Cultivation theory is a complex and nuanced theory that has been the subject of much research and debate. However, it remains one of the most important theories in mass communication, and it has helped to explain how television can shape our perceptions of reality.

Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. 4.4 Elaboration Likelihood Model The elaboration likelihood model (ELM) is a dual-process theory of persuasion that was developed by Richard E. Petty and John Cacioppo in 1980. The ELM proposes that there are two routes to persuasion: the central route and the peripheral route. The central route is a high-effort route to persuasion that involves carefully considering the message and evaluating the arguments presented. This route is more likely to be used when people are motivated and have the ability to think critically about the message. The peripheral route is a low-effort route to persuasion that involves relying on superficial cues, such as the source of the message or the way it is presented. This route is more likely to be used when people are not motivated or do not have the ability to think critically about the message. The ELM suggests that the effectiveness of a persuasive message depends on the route that is used. Messages that are processed through the central route are more likely to lead to lasting attitude change, while messages that are processed through the peripheral route are more likely to lead to temporary attitude change. The ELM has been supported by a number of studies, and it has been used to explain a wide range of persuasion phenomena, such as the effects of advertising, political campaigns, and social movements. Here are some of the key concepts of the ELM: Elaboration: The amount of cognitive effort that is put into processing a message. Motivation: The desire to process a message in a thoughtful and unbiased way. Ability: The ability to process a message in a thoughtful and unbiased way. Peripheral cues: Superficial cues that are used to evaluate a message, such as the source of the message or the way it is presented. Central route to persuasion: A high-effort route to persuasion that involves carefully considering the message and evaluating the arguments presented. Peripheral route to persuasion: A low-effort route to persuasion that involves relying on superficial cues, such as the source of the message or the way it is presented. The ELM is a complex and nuanced theory that has been the subject of much research and debate. However, it remains one of the most important theories in persuasion research, and it has helped to explain how people are persuaded by messages. References Petty, R. E., &amp; Cacioppo, J. T.

The theory was first proposed by Erving Goffman in 1974, and it has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena, such as the effects of news coverage on public opinion, the impact of advertising on consumer behavior, and the role of social movements in shaping public discourse. Framing theory suggests that the way an issue is presented can shape how people think about it by influencing the following: The salience of the issue: The extent to which the issue is noticed and remembered. The definition of the issue: The way the issue is understood and interpreted. The causal attributions: The reasons that are given for the issue. The moral implications: The ethical or moral dimensions of the issue. The emotional response: The feelings that are evoked by the issue. Framing theory has been supported by a number of studies, which have found that the way an issue is framed can have a significant impact on how people think about it and respond to it. For example, studies have shown that the way news stories about crime are framed can affect people’s fear of crime, and the way advertising is framed can affect people’s purchase decisions. Framing theory is a complex and nuanced theory that has been the subject of much research and debate. However, it remains an important framework for understanding how the way we communicate about issues can shape how people think about them. Here are some of the key concepts of framing theory: Frame: A way of presenting an issue that highlights certain aspects of the issue and obscures others. Framing effects: The ways in which the way an issue is framed can affect how people think about it and respond to it. Framing bias: The tendency for people to be more persuaded by messages that are framed in a way that is consistent with their existing beliefs and attitudes. Framing strategies: The techniques that are used to frame issues, such as the use of language, images, and metaphors. Framing theory has been applied to a wide range of topics, including politics, health, the environment, and social justice. The theory has also been used to examine the effects of different media, such as news, advertising, and social media. Framing theory is a powerful tool for understanding how the way we communicate about issues can shape how people think about them. By understanding how framing works, we can be more mindful of the ways in which our own communication can influence others. References Entman, R. M. (1993).

The theory was first proposed by Kurt Lewin in 1947, and it has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena, such as the effects of news coverage on public opinion, the impact of media bias, and the role of journalists in shaping public discourse. Gatekeeping theory suggests that there are a number of factors that can influence the news selection process, including: The gatekeepers: The people who make decisions about what news stories get covered and how they are presented. The news values: The criteria that are used to determine which news stories are newsworthy. The media environment: The economic, political, and social factors that shape the media. The audience: The people who consume news. Gatekeeping theory has been supported by a number of studies, which have found that the news selection process is often influenced by the gatekeepers’ personal biases, the news values of the media organization, and the political and economic climate. For example, studies have shown that journalists are more likely to cover stories that are consistent with their own political beliefs, and that news organizations are more likely to cover stories that are seen as being in the public interest or that are likely to attract a large audience. Gatekeeping theory is a complex and nuanced theory that has been the subject of much research and debate. However, it remains an important framework for understanding how decisions are made about what news stories get covered and how they are presented. Here are some of the key concepts of gatekeeping theory: Gatekeeper: A person who makes decisions about what news stories get covered and how they are presented. News values: The criteria that are used to determine which news stories are newsworthy. Media environment: The economic, political, and social factors that shape the media. Audience: The people who consume news. Personal bias: The personal beliefs and opinions of the gatekeeper. News organization: The media outlet where the gatekeeper works. Public interest: The perceived benefit to the public of covering a particular news story. Large audience: The perceived potential for a news story to attract a large number of viewers or readers. Gatekeeping theory has been applied to a wide range of topics, including politics, health, the environment, and social justice. The theory has also been used to examine the effects of different media, such as news, advertising, and social media. Gatekeeping theory is a powerful tool for understanding how decisions are made about what news stories get covered and how they are presented. By understanding how gatekeeping works, we can be more mindful of the ways in which our own news consumption can be influenced. References Lewin, K.

The theory was proposed by Joseph Walther in 1992, and it has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena, such as the development of online relationships, the impact of CMC on social interaction, and the role of CMC in shaping our self-presentation. The hyperpersonal model suggests that CMC can create more personal and intimate relationships than FtF communication because it offers a number of advantages, including: Attribution ambiguity: The sender’s physical appearance and nonverbal cues are not available in CMC, which allows the receiver to fill in the gaps with their own interpretations. Control over self-presentation: CMC allows users to control their self-presentation more than FtF communication, which can lead to more favorable impressions. Attribution confidence: CMC users are more likely to believe that they have accurate information about the other person, which can lead to more trust and intimacy. Interactivity: CMC is more interactive than traditional mass media, which allows for more communication and feedback between the sender and receiver. The hyperpersonal model has been supported by a number of studies, which have found that CMC users often report feeling more connected and intimate with their online partners than they do with their FtF partners. For example, one study found that CMC users were more likely to disclose personal information to their online partners than they were to their FtF partners. However, the hyperpersonal model has also been criticized for being too simplistic and for failing to take into account the role of other factors, such as the individual’s personality and the relationship context. Nevertheless, the hyperpersonal model remains an important framework for understanding how CMC can create more personal and intimate relationships than traditional FtF communication. Here are some of the key concepts of the hyperpersonal model: Attribution ambiguity: The lack of physical cues in CMC can lead to ambiguity about the sender’s intentions and personality. Control over self-presentation: CMC allows users to control how they are perceived by others. Attribution confidence: CMC users are more likely to believe that they have accurate information about the other person. Interactivity: CMC allows for more communication and feedback between the sender and receiver. Hyperpersonal communication: Communication that is more personal and intimate than traditional face-to-face communication. The hyperpersonal model has been applied to a wide range of topics, including online dating, online gaming, and social media. The theory has also been used to examine the effects of different CMC technologies, such as email, instant messaging, and social networking sites. The hyperpersonal model is a powerful tool for understanding how CMC can create more personal and intimate relationships than traditional FtF communication. By understanding how the hyperpersonal model works, we can be more mindful of the ways in which our own CMC interactions can be shaped. References Walther, J. B. (1992).

The theory was first proposed by Philip J. Tichenor, George A. Donohue, and Clarice N. Olien in 1970, and it has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena, such as the effects of news coverage on public opinion, the impact of educational campaigns, and the role of the media in shaping social inequality. The KGH suggests that the gap in knowledge between the informed and the uninformed will widen over time because of the following factors: Differential access to information: People with higher socioeconomic status (SES) are more likely to have access to information, such as through education, the media, and social networks. Differential motivation to learn: People with higher SES are more likely to be motivated to learn about new information, such as because they are more likely to be involved in civic activities or to have a need for the information. Differential ability to understand information: People with higher SES are more likely to be able to understand and retain new information, such as because they have more cognitive resources or because they are more familiar with the language and concepts used in the information. The KGH has been supported by a number of studies, which have found that the gap in knowledge between the informed and the uninformed does indeed widen over time. For example, one study found that the gap in knowledge about climate change between people with high and low levels of education widened over a period of 15 years. However, the KGH has also been criticized for being too simplistic and for failing to take into account the role of other factors, such as the individual’s motivation and the nature of the information. Nevertheless, the KGH remains an important framework for understanding how mass communication can contribute to social inequality. Here are some of the key concepts of the knowledge gap hypothesis: Knowledge gap: The difference in knowledge between the informed and the uninformed. Mass communication: The process of sending messages to a large audience through the media. Socioeconomic status (SES): A measure of a person’s social and economic position, such as their income, education, and occupation. Differential access to information: The unequal distribution of information among different groups of people. Differential motivation to learn: The different levels of motivation that people have to learn new information. Differential ability to understand information: The different levels of ability that people have to understand and retain new information. The KGH has been applied to a wide range of topics, such as public health, education, and politics. The theory has also been used to examine the effects of different media, such as news, advertising, and social media. The KGH is a powerful tool for understanding how mass communication can contribute to social inequality. By understanding how the KGH works, we can be more mindful of the ways in which our own communication can help to widen or narrow the knowledge gap. References Tichenor, P. J., Donohue, G.

The ODE can be attributed to a number of factors, including: Anonymity: When people are anonymous, they are less likely to feel inhibited by social conventions or norms. Immediacy: Online communication is often more immediate than face-to-face communication, which can lead to people saying things without thinking them through. Absence of cues: Online communication lacks many of the social cues that are present in face-to-face communication, such as body language and tone of voice. This can make it difficult to interpret messages and can lead to misunderstandings. Disinhibition: The ODE can also be attributed to a personality trait known as disinhibition, which is the tendency to act without thinking about the consequences. The ODE can have both positive and negative consequences. On the one hand, it can allow people to be more honest and open than they would be in person. This can be beneficial for communication and relationships. On the other hand, the ODE can also lead to cyberbullying, trolling, and other forms of online harassment. Here are some of the key concepts of the online disinhibition effect: Anonymity: The state of being unknown or unidentifiable. Immediacy: The quality of being happening or occurring at the same time. Absence of cues: The lack of social cues, such as body language and tone of voice, in online communication. Disinhibition: The tendency to act without thinking about the consequences. Online disinhibition effect (ODE): The phenomenon that occurs when people are more likely to say or do things online that they would not say or do in person. The ODE has been studied by psychologists and communication scholars for many years. There is still much that we do not know about the ODE, but it is a phenomenon that is important to understand in order to use online communication safely and effectively. Here are some of the ways to mitigate the negative effects of the ODE: Be aware of the ODE: The first step to mitigating the negative effects of the ODE is to be aware of it. Once you are aware of the ODE, you can start to think about how it might be affecting your online behavior. Be mindful of your audience: When you are communicating online, it is important to be mindful of your audience. Remember that the people you are communicating with may not be who they say they are. Think before you post: Before you post anything online, take a moment to think about what you are saying and how it might be interpreted. Use appropriate language: Be mindful of the language you use online. Avoid using language that could be offensive or hurtful. Be respectful: Always be respectful of others, even if you disagree with them. The ODE is a complex phenomenon, but by being aware of it and taking steps to mitigate its negative effects, we can use online communication safely and effectively. References Suler, J. (2004).

The term was coined by Donald Horton and Richard Wohl in 1956, who defined it as “the perception of the performer-audience relationship as involving mutual intimacy.” PSI can occur in any medium where there is a one-way flow of communication, such as television, radio, and the internet. It is most likely to occur when the media persona is perceived as being attractive, likable, and trustworthy. There are a number of factors that can contribute to PSI, including: The amount of exposure: The more exposure a person has to a media persona, the more likely they are to develop a parasocial relationship with that persona. The perceived similarity: People are more likely to develop parasocial relationships with media personas who they perceive as being similar to themselves. The perceived intimacy: The more intimate the relationship between the media persona and the viewer or listener is perceived to be, the more likely PSI is to occur. PSI can have both positive and negative consequences. On the one hand, it can provide comfort and companionship for people who are lonely or isolated. On the other hand, it can lead to unrealistic expectations about relationships and can make it difficult to form real-world relationships. Here are some of the key concepts of parasocial interaction: Parasocial interaction (PSI): The illusion of a close relationship between a media persona and a viewer or listener. Media persona: A person who is presented to an audience through a media medium. Viewer or listener: A person who consumes media content. Mutual intimacy: The perception that two people share a close and personal relationship. Unrealistic expectations: Expectations that are not based on reality. PSI has been studied by psychologists and communication scholars for many years. There is still much that we do not know about PSI, but it is a phenomenon that is important to understand in order to understand the effects of media on people.

The theory was developed by Albert Bandura in the 1960s, and it has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena, such as the development of aggression, the acquisition of prosocial behaviors, and the impact of media on behavior. Social learning theory is based on the following assumptions: People learn by observing and modeling the behaviors of others. This is known as observational learning. The learning process is influenced by a number of factors, including attention, retention, reproduction, and reinforcement. People are more likely to learn behaviors that are rewarded or reinforced. People are also more likely to learn behaviors that are performed by people they admire or respect. Social learning theory has been supported by a number of studies, which have found that people are more likely to imitate the behaviors of others when they are paying attention to those behaviors, when they can remember those behaviors, and when they are rewarded for imitating those behaviors. Social learning theory has been applied to a wide range of topics, such as aggression, prosocial behavior, and the impact of media on behavior. For example, studies have found that children who are exposed to violence in the media are more likely to behave aggressively themselves. This is because they are learning that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflict. Social learning theory is a powerful tool for understanding how people learn new behaviors. By understanding the principles of social learning theory, we can better understand how to promote positive behaviors and prevent negative behaviors. Here are some of the key concepts of social learning theory: Observational learning: The process of learning new behaviors by observing and modeling the behaviors of others. Attention: The process of paying attention to the behaviors of others. Retention: The process of remembering the behaviors of others. Reproduction: The process of imitating the behaviors of others. Reinforcement: A consequence that increases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated. Here are some of the key citations in APA 7th for social learning theory: Bandura, A.

Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. 4.12 Social Constructionism Social constructionism is a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of social interaction in shaping our understanding of the world. The theory was developed by a number of scholars, including Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann, who argued that knowledge is not objective or preexisting, but is instead created and negotiated through social interaction. Social constructionism is based on the following assumptions: There is no objective reality. What we perceive as reality is a social construct, created and negotiated through interaction with others. Knowledge is created through language. We use language to communicate our experiences and understandings of the world, and these shared understandings become the basis for knowledge. Knowledge is constantly changing. As we interact with others and our experiences change, our understanding of the world also changes. Social constructionism has been applied to a wide range of topics, including gender, race, and ethnicity. For example, social constructionists argue that gender is not a biological reality, but is instead a social construct that is created and negotiated through interaction. They point out that the way we think about gender varies across cultures and historical periods, which suggests that it is not an objective reality. Social constructionism has been criticized for being relativist, meaning that it suggests that there is no such thing as truth. However, social constructionists argue that this does not mean that anything goes. They believe that there are still shared understandings of the world that are worth striving for, even if these understandings are constantly changing. Here are some of the key concepts of social constructionism: Social constructivism: A theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of social interaction in shaping our understanding of the world. Knowledge: A shared understanding of the world that is created and negotiated through social interaction. Language: The primary tool that we use to communicate our experiences and understandings of the world. Reality: A social construct that is created and negotiated through social interaction. Here are some of the key citations in APA 7th for social constructionism: Berger, P., &amp; Luckmann, T. (1966). The social construction of reality. Garden City, NY: Anchor Books. Gergen, K. J.

Boston, MA: Wadsworth. 4.13 Social Exchange Theory Social exchange theory is a sociological and psychological theory that explains how people interact with each other based on the costs and rewards of those interactions. The theory was developed by George Homans in the 1950s, and it has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena, such as the formation of relationships, the development of norms, and the maintenance of social order. Social exchange theory is based on the following assumptions: People are motivated to maximize their rewards and minimize their costs. People make decisions about their interactions based on the perceived costs and rewards of those interactions. People’s expectations about the costs and rewards of an interaction can be influenced by their past experiences, their social norms, and their individual goals. Social exchange theory has been supported by a number of studies, which have found that people are more likely to interact with others who they perceive as being rewarding. For example, studies have found that people are more likely to be friends with people who are similar to them, who are attractive, and who are kind and supportive. Social exchange theory has been applied to a wide range of topics, such as interpersonal relationships, group dynamics, and organizations. For example, social exchange theory can be used to explain why people stay in relationships that are not satisfying, why people conform to social norms, and why people cooperate with each other in organizations. Social exchange theory is a powerful tool for understanding how people interact with each other. By understanding the principles of social exchange theory, we can better understand why people behave the way they do and how to influence their behavior. Here are some of the key concepts of social exchange theory: Cost: The negative consequences of an interaction. Reward: The positive consequences of an interaction. Expectation: The perceived likelihood that an interaction will result in a particular outcome. Norm: A shared expectation about how people should behave in a particular situation. Goal: A desired outcome that a person is trying to achieve. Here are some of the key citations in APA 7th for social exchange theory: Homans, G. C. (1958). Social behavior as exchange.

The theory was developed by Henri Tajfel and John Turner in the 1970s, and it has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena, such as prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup conflict. Social identity theory is based on the following assumptions: People have a fundamental need to belong to groups. People define themselves in terms of their group memberships. People are motivated to maintain a positive social identity, which is the perception that their own group is positive and valuable. People make comparisons between their own group and other groups. These comparisons can lead to positive in-group bias, where people favor their own group over other groups. Social identity theory has been supported by a number of studies, which have found that people are more likely to favor their own group over other groups, even when the groups are not objectively different. For example, studies have found that people are more likely to help members of their own group than members of other groups, and they are more likely to view members of their own group more favorably than members of other groups. Social identity theory has been applied to a wide range of topics, such as prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup conflict. For example, social identity theory can be used to explain why people are prejudiced against members of other groups, why people discriminate against members of other groups, and why intergroup conflict occurs. Social identity theory is a powerful tool for understanding how people’s group memberships affect their self-concept and behavior. By understanding the principles of social identity theory, we can better understand why people behave the way they do in intergroup contexts. Here are some of the key concepts of social identity theory: Social identity: The part of a person’s self-concept that is derived from their membership in a social group. In-group: The group to which a person belongs. Out-group: A group to which a person does not belong. Positive in-group bias: The tendency to favor one’s own group over other groups.

London, UK: Sage. 4.15 Social Information Processing Theory Social information processing theory (SIP) is a cognitive theory of social interaction that was developed by Kenneth Dodge in the 1980s. The theory explains how people make sense of social interactions and how these interpretations influence their behavior. SIP is based on the following assumptions: People are active processors of social information. They attend to and interpret cues from the social environment. They generate and evaluate possible responses to these cues. They choose the response that they believe will be most successful. SIP has been supported by a number of studies, which have found that people do indeed process social information in the way that SIP predicts. For example, studies have found that people are more likely to attend to and remember negative information about others, and they are more likely to interpret ambiguous cues in a negative way. SIP has been applied to a wide range of topics, such as aggression, bullying, and social anxiety. For example, SIP can be used to explain why some people are more likely to be aggressive than others, why some people are more likely to be bullied, and why some people are more likely to experience social anxiety. SIP is a powerful tool for understanding how people make sense of social interactions and how these interpretations influence their behavior. By understanding the principles of SIP, we can better understand why people behave the way they do in social situations. Here are some of the key concepts of social information processing theory: Social cues: The verbal and nonverbal signals that people use to communicate with each other. Interpretation: The meaning that people give to social cues. Responses: The behaviors that people choose to enact in response to social cues. Social goals: The desired outcomes that people are trying to achieve in social interactions. Here are some of the key citations in APA 7th for social information processing theory: Dodge, K. A.

The theory was developed in the 1940s by Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch, and it has been revised and updated over time. UGT is based on the following assumptions: People are active users of media. They use media to fulfill their needs and wants. The needs and wants that people seek to fulfill through media use vary from person to person. The media environment offers a variety of options for fulfilling these needs and wants. UGT has been supported by a number of studies, which have found that people do indeed use media to fulfill their needs and wants. For example, studies have found that people use media to escape from reality, to learn new things, and to connect with others. UGT has been applied to a wide range of topics, such as media effects, media use, and media literacy. For example, UGT can be used to explain why people watch violent television shows, why people use social media, and why people are more likely to believe fake news. UGT is a powerful tool for understanding why people use media. By understanding the principles of UGT, we can better understand the effects of media on people and how people can use media to their advantage. Here are some of the key concepts of uses and gratifications theory: Needs: The psychological and social needs that people seek to fulfill through media use. Wants: The specific things that people hope to achieve through media use. Media: The different types of media that people can use to fulfill their needs and wants. Uses: The ways in which people use media to fulfill their needs and wants. Gratifications: The benefits that people receive from using media. Here are some of the key citations in APA 7th for uses and gratifications theory: Katz, E., Blumler, J. G., &amp; Gurevitch, M. (1974).

This information can be used to answer research questions, develop new theories, and create policies and programs that are more effective and relevant to the people they serve. Interviews are a valuable research tool because they allow researchers to get a deeper understanding of the human experience than other methods, such as surveys or questionnaires. By talking to people in person, researchers can observe their nonverbal communication, ask follow-up questions, and build rapport. This can lead to richer, more nuanced data that can be used to answer research questions in a more comprehensive way. Interviews can be used in a variety of research settings, including: Qualitative research: Interviews are a common method of data collection in qualitative research, which is a type of research that focuses on understanding the meaning of people’s experiences. Qualitative researchers often use interviews to gather in-depth information about participants’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Quantitative research: Interviews can also be used in quantitative research, which is a type of research that focuses on measuring and analyzing data. Quantitative researchers often use interviews to gather data about participants’ demographics, attitudes, or behaviors. Mixed methods research: Interviews can also be used in mixed methods research, which is a type of research that combines qualitative and quantitative methods. Mixed methods researchers often use interviews to gather in-depth information about participants’ experiences, which they then use to develop and test quantitative hypotheses. No matter what type of research is being conducted, interviews are a valuable tool for gathering rich, in-depth data from participants. By understanding the purpose of interviewing in research and using it effectively, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the human experience and create more meaningful and impactful research. Here are some of the benefits of using interviews in research: In-depth information: Interviews allow researchers to gather in-depth information about participants’ experiences, opinions, and perspectives. This information can be used to answer research questions in a more comprehensive way. Rich data: Interviews can provide researchers with rich data that is not possible to obtain through other research methods, such as surveys or questionnaires. This data can be used to develop new theories and create policies and programs that are more effective and relevant to the people they serve. Personal connection: Interviews allow researchers to build personal connections with participants. This can help to create a more trusting environment and encourage participants to share their true thoughts and feelings. Flexibility: Interviews can be conducted in a variety of settings and formats. This flexibility allows researchers to adapt the interview to the needs of the participants and the research question. However, there are also some challenges associated with using interviews in research: Time-consuming: Interviews can be time-consuming to conduct and transcribe. This can be a challenge for researchers who are working on tight deadlines. Subjectivity: Interviews can be subjective, as the interviewer’s own biases can influence the way the interview is conducted and interpreted. This can be a challenge for researchers who are trying to gather objective data. Cost: Interviews can be expensive to conduct, as researchers need to pay for the interviewer’s time and travel expenses. This can be a challenge for researchers who are working with limited budgets. Overall, interviews are a valuable research tool that can be used to gather rich, in-depth information from participants. However, it is important to be aware of the challenges associated with using interviews in research and to take steps to mitigate these challenges. 5.2 Approaches of Interviews There are three main approaches to interviews in research: structured interviews, semi-structured interviews, and unstructured interviews. Structured interviews: Structured interviews use a set of predetermined questions that are asked to all participants in the same order. This type of interview is often used for research purposes, as it ensures that all participants are asked the same questions and that the data is comparable. Semi-structured interviews: Semi-structured interviews use a set of predetermined questions, but the interviewer is also allowed to ask follow-up questions based on the participant’s answers. This type of interview is often used for evaluation or diagnosis purposes, as it allows the interviewer to get more detailed information about the participant’s experiences. Unstructured interviews: Unstructured interviews do not use any predetermined questions. The interviewer simply talks to the participant and asks questions as they arise. This type of interview is often used for therapy or treatment purposes, as it allows the interviewer to get a deeper understanding of the participant’s thoughts and feelings. The approach to interviews that is best suited for a particular research project will depend on the research question, the participants, and the resources available. Here is a table that summarizes the three approaches to interviews in research: Approach Description Benefits Challenges Structured interviews Use a set of predetermined questions that are asked to all participants in the same order. Ensures that all participants are asked the same questions and that the data is comparable. Can be inflexible and does not allow for in-depth exploration of topics. Semi-structured interviews Use a set of predetermined questions, but the interviewer is also allowed to ask follow-up questions based on the participant’s answers. Allows for more in-depth exploration of topics and can be tailored to the individual participant. Can be more time-consuming to conduct and analyze. Unstructured interviews Do not use any predetermined questions. The interviewer simply talks to the participant and asks questions as they arise. Allows for the deepest level of exploration of topics and can build rapport with participants. Can be difficult to analyze and can be biased by the interviewer’s own opinions. Ultimately, the best approach to interviews in research is the one that best suits the research question, the participants, and the resources available. 5.3 Negotiating Access Negotiating access for interviews in research can be a challenging task, but it is essential to the success of any research project that relies on interviews. Here are some tips for negotiating access for interviews in research: Be clear about your research goals. The first step in negotiating access is to be clear about your research goals. What are you hoping to learn from the interviews? What are the specific questions you want to ask? Once you have a clear understanding of your research goals, you can start to craft a proposal that will appeal to potential participants. Build rapport with gatekeepers. In many cases, you will need to get permission from gatekeepers before you can conduct interviews with potential participants. Gatekeepers are people who control access to a particular group or population. They may be managers, supervisors, or other authority figures. It is important to build rapport with gatekeepers and to explain the benefits of your research project. Be respectful of potential participants’ time. When you are negotiating access for interviews, it is important to be respectful of potential participants’ time. Explain how long the interview will take and what the interview will involve. Be prepared to answer any questions that potential participants may have. Offer incentives. In some cases, you may need to offer incentives to potential participants to encourage them to participate in interviews. This could include things like gift cards, reimbursement for travel expenses, or even just a thank-you note. Be flexible. Be prepared to be flexible when negotiating access for interviews. Things don’t always go according to plan, so it’s important to be willing to adapt your approach. For example, if a potential participant is not available for an interview at the time you requested, be willing to reschedule. Negotiating access for interviews can be a challenging task, but it is essential to the success of any research project that relies on interviews. By following these tips, you can increase your chances of getting the access you need to conduct your research. Here are some additional tips for negotiating access for interviews in research: Do your research. Before you approach potential participants or gatekeepers, take the time to learn as much as you can about the group or population you are interested in studying. This will help you to tailor your proposal to their specific needs and interests. Be prepared to answer questions. Potential participants and gatekeepers will likely have questions about your research project. Be prepared to answer these questions in a clear and concise way. Be professional. When you are negotiating access for interviews, it is important to be professional and respectful. This will help to build trust and rapport with potential participants and gatekeepers. Be persistent. Don’t give up if you don’t get access to the participants you want right away. Keep trying and eventually you will find the right people to interview. Negotiating access for interviews can be a challenging task, but it is an essential part of any research project that relies on interviews. By following these tips, you can increase your chances of getting the access you need to conduct your research. 5.4 Sampling Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of participants from a larger population for participation in a research study. In the context of interviews, sampling is used to ensure that the participants are representative of the population that the researcher is interested in studying. There are two main types of sampling methods used in interviews: probability sampling and non-probability sampling. Probability sampling methods ensure that each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for participation in the study. This is done by using a random number generator to select participants or by using a table of random numbers. Probability sampling methods are considered to be the most accurate way to select a sample, but they can also be more time-consuming and expensive. Non-probability sampling methods do not ensure that each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for participation in the study. This is because participants are selected based on their availability, willingness to participate, or other factors. Non-probability sampling methods are less accurate than probability sampling methods, but they are often faster and cheaper. The most common non-probability sampling methods used in interviews are: Convenience sampling: Convenience sampling involves selecting participants who are convenient to the researcher. This could include people who are friends, family, or colleagues of the researcher, or people who are easily accessible, such as students or employees. Convenience sampling is the least accurate sampling method, but it is also the fastest and cheapest. Purposive sampling: Purposive sampling involves selecting participants who have specific characteristics that are relevant to the research question. For example, a researcher who is interested in studying the experiences of women who have experienced domestic violence might use purposive sampling to select participants who have experienced domestic violence. Purposive sampling is more accurate than convenience sampling, but it can also be more time-consuming and expensive. Snowball sampling: Snowball sampling involves starting with a small group of participants and then asking them to recommend other participants who might be interested in participating in the study. Snowball sampling can be a good way to reach hard-to-reach populations, but it can also lead to bias if the initial participants are not representative of the population as a whole. The best sampling method to use for a particular research project will depend on the research question, the resources available, and the time constraints. Here are some additional tips for sampling for interviews in research: Consider the purpose of the study. The purpose of the study will help to determine the best sampling method to use. For example, if the researcher is interested in making generalizations about a population, then a probability sampling method is likely the best choice. However, if the researcher is interested in getting a deeper understanding of a particular group of people, then a non-probability sampling method may be more appropriate. Consider the resources available. Sampling methods can vary in terms of time, cost, and difficulty. The researcher should choose a sampling method that is feasible given the resources available. Consider the time constraints. Some sampling methods, such as probability sampling, can be time-consuming to implement. The researcher should choose a sampling method that is appropriate for the timeline of the research project. Sampling is an important part of any research project that uses interviews. By carefully considering the purpose of the study, the resources available, and the time constraints, the researcher can choose the best sampling method to ensure that the results of the study are accurate and reliable. 5.5 Role of Researcher The role of the researcher in interviews in research is to gather information from participants about their experiences, opinions, and perspectives on a particular topic.

The focus group may take some time to get started, so be patient and allow the participants to warm up to the discussion. Be flexible. Things don’t always go according to plan, so be flexible and adapt the discussion as needed. End the focus group on time. Thank the participants for their time and let them know that the focus group is over. Conducting a focus group for research can be a valuable tool for gathering data and insights from a group of people. By following these tips, you can conduct a focus group that is effective and that produces reliable data. Analyzing Focus Group Data Analyzing focus group data for research is an important step in making sense of the information that was gathered and drawing conclusions. Here are some tips for analyzing focus group data for research: Transcribe the focus group verbatim. This will make it easier to analyze the data and to identify patterns and themes. Read through the transcripts carefully. Pay attention to the tone of the conversation, the body language of the participants, and the overall flow of the discussion. Identify patterns and themes. Look for patterns in the participants’ responses. What are the common themes that emerge? Code the data. This involves assigning codes to different parts of the transcripts. This will help you to organize the data and to identify patterns and themes more easily. Write memos. As you are analyzing the data, write memos to yourself to capture your thoughts and insights. This will help you to stay organized and to make sense of the data. Interpret the data. Once you have identified patterns and themes, interpret the data. What do the patterns and themes mean? What do they tell you about the topic of your research? Write a report. Write a report that describes the focus group, the questions asked, the findings, and the implications of the findings. By following these tips, you can analyze focus group data for research in a systematic and objective way. This will help you to draw conclusions that are valid and reliable. Here are some additional tips for analyzing focus group data for research: Use a coding system. A coding system is a way of organizing the data into categories. This can make it easier to identify patterns and themes. Use a computer program. There are a number of computer programs that can be used to analyze focus group data. These programs can help you to code the data, identify patterns and themes, and write a report. Get feedback from others. Once you have analyzed the data, get feedback from others. This can help you to identify any areas where your analysis may be flawed. Be open to new ideas. As you are analyzing the data, be open to new ideas. Don’t be afraid to change your mind if the data suggests that your original interpretation was wrong. Analyzing focus group data for research can be a challenging task, but it is an important one. By following these tips, you can analyze the data in a systematic and objective way. This will help you to draw conclusions that are valid and reliable. Pros and Cons of Focus Groups Here are some of the pros and cons of focus groups for research: Pros: They can provide insights into the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of a target audience. Focus groups can be a great way to get a deep understanding of how people think about a particular topic. This can be helpful for understanding customer needs, developing new products or services, or evaluating marketing campaigns. They can be used to generate new ideas and concepts. By bringing together a group of people with different perspectives, you can get a wide range of ideas that you might not have thought of on your own. They can be used to test hypotheses and assumptions. By asking participants questions about their thoughts and feelings, you can get a better understanding of whether or not your assumptions are correct. They can be used to get feedback on products, services, and marketing campaigns. By asking participants about their thoughts and feelings, you can get valuable insights into how they perceive your offerings and how you can improve them. They can be used to build relationships with stakeholders. By bringing together a group of people who are interested in your work, you can get to know them better and understand their needs and concerns. Cons: They can be time-consuming and expensive to conduct. Focus groups require a lot of planning and coordination, and they can be expensive to pay for participants’ time and travel expenses. They can be difficult to recruit participants who are representative of the target audience. It can be difficult to find people who are willing to participate in a focus group, and it can be even more difficult to find people who are representative of the target audience. The results of focus groups can be subjective and may not be generalizable to a larger population. The results of focus groups can be influenced by the moderator, the participants, and the environment in which the focus group is conducted. This can make it difficult to generalize the results to a larger population. The moderator can influence the results of the focus group. The moderator plays a key role in a focus group, and they can influence the results of the discussion. This is why it is important to have a moderator who is impartial and who has experience conducting focus groups. Overall, focus groups can be a valuable tool for qualitative research. They can provide insights into the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of a target audience. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of focus groups and to use them in conjunction with other research methods.

Continuous Data Discrete and continuous data are two types of quantitative data. The main difference between them is the type of information they represent. Discrete data typically only shows information for a particular event, while continuous data often shows trends in data over time. Here are some of the key differences between discrete and continuous data: Discrete data can be counted, while continuous data can be measured. For example, the number of students in a class is discrete data, while the height of a student is continuous data. Discrete data has distinct values, while continuous data can have an infinite number of possible values. For example, the number of sides on a die is discrete data, while the temperature on a day can have an infinite number of possible values. *Discrete data is often represented by integers, while continuous data is often represented by real numbers. For example, the number of students in a class can be represented by the integer 30, while the height of a student can be represented by the real number 1.7 meters.

To assist with this, the first assignment is a welcome post. Within this course on Blackboard, you must post a welcome post. In this welcome post, include an image of yourself and answers to the following questions. What is your name? Where are you from? What is your desired career? What is your favorite hobby? What is your biggest pet peeve? What is your favorite media properties to consume (e.g., The West Wing, One Punch Man, Call of Duty, Harry Potter)? What would you like to study this semester? (this can be specific or broad) IRB Certification Be sure to complete the CITI training. APA Assignment Please provide accurate APA Reference List citations for the references provided on Blackboard in a .docx file. Please submit as a .doc or .docx file. Be sure to follow APA 7th Edition rules. Annotated Bibliography Individuals are tasked with submitting a set of four (4) annotated bibliographies that are potentially relevant to their paper. Individuals are to submit unique annotated bibliographies. This means that if you and your team members collaborate on finding sources, you each must annotate different sources.. I recommned at least being from an academic paper or reputible scholarly book (preference toward paper). I will attach a word document with formatting and content suggestions to this assignment. Visualization Assignment The visualization assignment will be posted as an .Rmd file on Blackboard. You are expected to create a new R Project for this assignment and then submit the zipped project on Blackboard. You may work on this as a group; however, I expect your visualizations to be moderately unique. Do not plagiarize! Analysis Assignment The analysis assignment will be posted as an .Rmd file on Blackboard. You are expected to create a new R Project for this assignment and then submit the zipped project on Blackboard. Each analysis question will require the code to run the analysis and your individual interpretation. You may work on this as a group; however, I expect your interpretation to be in your own words. Do not plagiarize! Section Quizzes I will divide your book into five (5) sections and create five (5) minor quizzes. These quizzes will be posted around midterm. You will then have until the last week of class (before final’s week) to submit all the quizzes. Team Partner Contract I will attach a word document on Blackboard as a template partner contract. All team members must sign before submission. Common Tasks (suggestions) Outliner Reference Manager Run analyses (in R) Create visualizations (in R) Reference Summarizer Presenter Lead Writer for Section (How to Write APA Style Research Papers) Introduction Literature Review Methodology Results Discussion Conclusion Topic Selection Submit your topic selection, including potential theories and rough research hypotheses or questions. You can find theories in the theories chapter. Example: We plan to survey students to identify a correlation between media usage and satisfaction. Borrowing from uses and gratification theory (though our theory choice may change as we spend more time reading), we expect individuals to select their media based upon the needs they are attempting to fulfill. Types of media include traditional (e.g., television, movies) and new (e.g., TikTok, YouTube). We are interested in if any usage impacts quality of life and if quantity of usage controls for some variation. If we receive a diverse enough participant pool, we are also interested in home type (i.e., single, family [as child], friends, partner, family [as parent]). Our interest in home type is a reflection of the pandemic’s limiting of outside interaction. IRB Application Each student must submit proof of IRB application submission. Each team must add me to their application so that I can access the material. You are graded on submitting a full application on time and how few revisions are required to pass. Please reach out to me before submission so I can advise you on your project and accuracy. Research Questions/Hypotheses You are to present at least two (2) concise research questions (RQ) or hypotheses (RH) that your team want to examine. These RQs/RHs must include at least one (1) independent variable and one (1) dependent variable. These variables must be measurable for your project. If you have questions, please reach out before this assignment is due. Research Proposal Your research proposal is intended to be your first three (3) sections of your research paper: literature review, research objective, and methods. The proposal does not have to be a perfect version of these sections; however, the closer these are to complete, the work your team will have later in the semester. I will post more specifics on Blackboard during the semester. Outline Your outline is intended to give me a sneak peak of where you stand with your final three (3) sections of your research paper (i.e., results, discussion, and conclusion) before your final paper is due. The outline must be in numbers/bulleted format and not paragraph. The text in the outline can either be small phrases or full sentences. This is your final chance for feedback before you focus down on your final project. Full Paper At the completion of this course, all student will have to submit a full research paper with their teams. Specifics will be presented throughout the semester. Presentation To accompany your final paper, your group is required to present your paper. Not all members have to present; however, this relies on your partner contract. The presentation will be done during our scheduled time for our final (December 12, 10-11:40 am).  7-10 minutes Powerpoint Include key sections (Literature, RQ/RH, Methods, Results, Discussion) Provide context Beyond that, your presentation is up to you. Submit your PowerPoint slides on Blackboard. You must also submit your partner contract with any important changes and commentary to reflect an imbalance in workload.
