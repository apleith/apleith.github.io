<p>Welcome to <em>Introduction to Communication and Media Research with R</em>. I am Alex P. Leith, an Assistant Professor in the Mass Communications department at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. While a doctoral student at Michigan State University, I fell in love with the flexibility of the R program for data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. My intention with this book is to build an introductory research book for communication and media professionals that are tasked with research. For college students, this text is intended for individuals with either zero or limited research experience.</p>
<p>This book is also a practice in applying generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) in writing drafts. Namely, the first draft of this paper is a mix of human and AI writing. As I continue to work on this book, I will clean the text until limited traces of AI remain. I am using AI (e.g., Chat GPT, Google Bard) to identify future uses of these tools that still allow for individual work and learning opportunities. This book also borrows structure from existing research methods books.</p>
<p>Communication research systematically studies the processes, antecedents, and consequences of communication. It is a broad field encompassing various topics, from interpersonal to mass communication. Media research is the study of the effects of mass media on society, culture, and individuals. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including the impact of media on news consumption, political attitudes, and consumer behavior. Communication and media researchers use various methods to collect data, including surveys, interviews, focus groups, and experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Research Ethics</strong></p>
<p>Research ethics is the set of moral principles that guide the conduct of research. It is essential to ensure that research is conducted ethically to protect the rights and welfare of research participants, ensure the validity of research findings, and build public trust in research. Several ethical principles are relevant to research, including respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. In addition to these general ethical principles, there are also specific ethical guidelines for different types of research.</p>
<p><strong>Research Papers</strong></p>
<p>An academic research paper is a piece of writing that presents the results of original research on a particular topic. It is typically written in a formal style and follows a specific format. Academic research papers are usually published in academic journals or presented at conferences. Research papers are discoverable through search engines available through academic libraries, publishers’ websites, and search engines (e.g., Google Scholar).</p>
<p><strong>Qualitative Methods</strong></p>
<p>Qualitative research methods seek to understand the meaning of human experiences and interactions through detailed, in-depth exploration. They are often used in communication and media research to understand how people use and interpret media, as well as the impact of media on society. Common methods are interviews, focus groups, ethnography, and content analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Quantitative Methods</strong></p>
<p>Quantitative research methods seek to understand the world through numbers and statistical analysis. They are often used in communication and media research to test hypotheses about the relationship between variables, such as the impact of media on attitudes or behavior. Most quantitative studies use content analysis, surveys, or experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to R</strong></p>
<p>R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a free and open-source software environment, making it available to everyone to use and modify. R is used by statisticians, data miners, and researchers in various fields. The program allows individuals to use code to expedite data cleaning and analysis tasks. Users are also provided with a range of options for data visualization.</p>
<p><strong>Working with Data</strong></p>
<p>Data is a collection of facts, figures, or observations that can be used to answer questions or test hypotheses. Data can be collected from various sources, including surveys, experiments, and observations. Once data has been collected, it needs to be prepared for analysis. This process typically involves cleaning the data, formatting the data, and transforming the data. Researchers can either use R for these stages or external programs (e.g., Excel).</p>
<p><strong>Visuals</strong></p>
<p>There are many different types of data visualization, each with strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most common types of data visualization include bar charts, scatter plots, images, or tables. The best kind of data visualization for a particular dataset depends on the specific research question and the study’s goals. Choosing a data visualization that is easy to understand and accurately represents the data is essential.</p>
<p><strong>Analyses</strong></p>
<p>Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, inform conclusions, and support decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under various names in different business, science, and social science domains. For our context, we are most interested in descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize data and describe its main features. They can be used to calculate measures of central tendency (such as the mean, median, and mode) and measures of variation (such as the standard deviation). Inferential statistics are used to make inferences about a population based on a sample. They can be used to test hypotheses and estimate parameters. The best type of data analysis for a particular dataset will depend on the specific research question being asked and the goals of the study. Choosing a data analysis method that is appropriate for the data and will help answer the research question is vital.</p>
