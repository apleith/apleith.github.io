<p>hello class and welcome to your lesson on surveys chapter 15.
um service is your final of your actual research methods before we start getting into um types of analyses um surveys is probably the most classically known the one which everyone probably has the most experience with surveys is a social scientific research instrument where respondents are asked questions about their own or other individuals attitudes behaviors beliefs perceptions and or values so for most times i’m working with surveys you’re asking individuals to report either about themselves or about a second party or third party what you’re asking here as far as individual insights as to your questions um and we’ll talk more about what that means well that includes what that excludes um later most appropriate when you need new data um for some reason there’s not enough data out there in the world yet and you need individuals to make account for things um for example because you can’t there’s no other way for you to get data about usage of something or actions or behaviors you ask them through surveys when people are best at providing the data about what you’re studying there are a number of times um for example i do a lot of machine learning work in my machine learning work is i sit there and i collect data that’s previously been shared without being prompted what we’re working on here is individuals you’re trying to find data that they haven’t openly shared yet and so when you try to find people to talk about their actions the best way to do that is to come to them sorry scan through that okay how to create a survey first you choose a theoretical framework to guide your study one of the big things with surveys is um you are not attempting here to do exploratory work at the point of surveys you should have a framework for what you’re attempting to predict um you’re attempting to predict uses and gratifications you’re attempting to predict motivation you’re attempting to predict outcomes um perceptions and she should have a theory there waiting for you to guide you as to why you should expect this um from there you develop your research hypotheses or research questions that you need a survey to test um just like with this as i’m saying this isn’t exploratory there’s very little there should be very little haziness as to what you’re hoping to get out of your research you should have very clear idea of what you’re expecting for this purpose it’s almost you’re almost always going to be using hypotheses in these cases but you can still use research questions if for example your theories present something will happen but because of the convergence of multiple effects you won’t be able to know what which of these theories or which of these predictions will actually have greater weight and so from those you have questions because there’s enough unknown that you know something’s going to happen but you don’t know what’s going to happen create a new survey or use a pre-existing one there’s a lot of options here my greatest recommendation especially for junior researchers or early scholars is to always use a survey if it exists if you can if you find papers that have already done work on what you’re trying to do and you’re trying to apply that work to a new field or to a new platform you should always try to use surveys that are already existing otherwise when you’re trying to use having my keyboard for no reason when you’re trying to use surveys that when trying to build your own surveys there’s gonna be a lot of extra work to test to make sure your survey is accurate however if you use a pre-existing survey then you will know for a fact that that your questions have a level of validity that are bloody in the sense that um what you’re attempting to test is provable off of the outcomes and when you’re building a new survey there’s no way to know if if you’re let’s say you’re testing for motivations there’s no way to know that if your survey actually tests for motivations until you’ve run that survey through a few times alongside other metrics if you’ll engage with yes i am consistently proving choose motivations survey type there’s a number of different survey types um i think one of the most classic ideas is to um use these likert scales and such um use the type of survey in which um it’s very clearly people very clearly understand what you’re asking them to do which comes down to be sure the survey is clear with whatever method you’re using for a survey whichever technique or type of survey you’re using it is important that whoever’s taking the survey can get through it quickly the more mental processing it takes for someone to get through a survey the more likely it is that they will not actually get through it correctly um you’ll have to get rid of surveys because people just get tired of taking them after the first few minutes decide on survey collection method um most times um there’s a lot of different methods i think you can think of the very basic ones uh four basic ones um face to face um over over the phone i guess it’s five over mail over internet that’s four um one of the things that you can always do is um what you want what you’re wanting to have happen is able to um increase the likelihood for reply um there’s certain benefits of trying to do face-to-face surveys it helps ensure clarity um but one advantage of doing something less face-to-face like internet-based you’re more likely you can send more out without having the higher increasing costs and then that way um you’ll get a lower reply rate but you’ll also be able to send out tens and hundreds of times more surveys um pilot test the survey um when you’re working on a new platform working or applying and surveying a new way it’s important to kind of test the server to make sure it works if you if you’re giving a service it’s almost always been given in a lab experiment so let’s say it’s always been given face to face at a lab following some um some experimental conditions and you’re now using it in the field through phone interview through phone surveys or through web surveys it’s important to pilot tests to make sure that none of that information is lost and then finally once you pilot test it collect your data theoretical framework that guy’s a study ask yourself what are you studying as i’ve mentioned before one of the most important things when you’re doing when dealing with um surveys is that you need to know for sure exactly what you’re studying um because as opposed to an interview where along along the path of interviewing someone they’ll pop up ideas and you can follow up with those ideas and you can address new things when working with someone through surveys there’s no ability to change a full course so that means you need to go going in what am i studying and what are the phenomenon you’re interested in testing exploring with your survey as you know those and you have your theory to help guide it and help direct you through it then just becomes more and more likely you’re going to be able to get the actual answers and outcomes you’re expecting to look for hypotheses and or research questions develop research questions and hypotheses for your study survey research is deductive begin with a theory of interest and purpose and propose hypothesis research questions in each of these cases you’re trying to start from something that you have expected knowledge and you’re trying to deduce from your findings to do some of the surveys if those theories or things hold up um so you’re trying to see is there something new here um for example i do a lot of stuff where i study old theory in new environments so i take old classic face-to-face theories or classic media theories and i apply them to hyper interpersonal systems but with between individuals who aren’t necessarily connected um and so what i do is i want to see if stuff still exists or if it changes and these are kind of things that you go into and try to find from your surveys survey design is to measure the variables and test hypotheses research questions and so one of the things that can also happen is you can also take out these surveys and make sure that they’re fine-tuned for your needs it’s not uncommon to take larger surveys and based on previous validity tests go i can group these surveys i can group these questions together i don’t need the entire 20 questions for this um it’s been previously tested for these 12 together or these eight together will find this specific topic and you can start to build kind of a frankenstein together surveys based on very distinct needs that you have which will help you design your measure to best reach your research research questions and hypotheses create a new or user preseason survey um as a kind of relationship before but creating a new instrument involves extensive statistical analyses um it’s really easy to ask people a lot of questions about um their motivations it’s not as easy to ensure that those are actually getting to the point of their mo actually testing motivation when you’re using pre-existing measures um there’s also be cautious there make sure your choice is based on in theory so just because things kind of are similar make sure the theory is is precisely able to apply a survey to them to your um to your research and instrument should be reliable and valid um if you’re going to be using an existing survey it’s important to make sure that this has out even validity tested if you’re using someone’s survey and there’s no validity testing involved then you may as well build your own survey um and that’s one of the things that’s important to understand and it’s one of the processes you can go through to help kind of identify um the reliability and validity of your survey survey types um this one breaks it out of two general ideas paper-based web-based paper-based surveys surveys are printed on paper and provides participants um if you’ve ever been to a mall um at least i remember back in the early aughts um when i was still a mall goer i believe i guess um it wouldn’t be uncommon to have someone standing outside of a store at one of the anchors and they go hey do you have five minutes to answer questions this is a very reliable thing i did this in undergrad um for when i was working for people doing pr work um so it’s important that face to face you ask people questions surveys are usually given to your distance in one of four ways face to face take home in the mail or over the phone these paper-based surveys i guess they break them down into these kind of more distinct methods um most times when you’re hanging people these surveys it’s helpful for you to walk through it with them um one of the things that’s super important here is especially if you’re mailing things out or sending things out over the phone to make sure that they have an easy way to get back to you so if you send if you send them something to do over the mail the likelihood of them mailing it back if they don’t have like prepaid um replies is very low and so these are kind of things that you kind of get eaten up in the cost of doing research web-based surveys presented and collected entirely online more and more data collected online um and says that we’re finding it easier and easier for people who are who are fighting that more and more of the demographic more and more demographics are finding themselves online with at least this semi balance literacy a semi at least semi-literate in online interactions and so it’s becoming easier and easier to get older people and younger people involved in surveys um this was the website very monkey um the university uh we used qualtrics which is a pretty which is the standard survey method used for most universities um in a lot of large companies and so these are the kind of things that we walk through kind of the first classic paper based versus web-based although this is how the book separates it i’m not a huge fan of separating all of these classic ones into paper based because having an actual paper with a person is very different than having someone um read the paper over the phone but the one advantage is um face-to-face on the phone is that someone’s walking through the questions take home and then mail persons walking through them walking through them on their own which is very similar to the web-based pros and cons of each um no matter which survey method you choose there will be cons um and there will be pros like one i think one of the great things about web base is that it’s easier and easier for people to find time to take a five minute survey if they can get you whatever they want um whereas telephones if you can’t catch people on the phone at the right time people are unlikely to reschedule a time for you to call them back and so you’re gonna have to call a lot more people the difference is for example paper-based um people are um you’re more likely to get people just to agree to help if you do it in person however and here’s a con you’re also more likely to get someone to lie and face to face especially if you’re dealing with something that’s either sensitive or that the participant feels may be sensitive and so these are things that you want to weigh yourself um do you think it’d be beneficial to have something to pressure someone talking to them or do you feel like that would give them an easier chance to um contradict or or obscure the truth clear service is super important clear instructions needed um if you’re giving them a likert scale um make sure that they know when a five is good and when a five is bad or at least when a five is high and something one of five is low in something um if you’re dealing them with other metrics or things make sure that they understand um if the first thing something’s for because it’s not uncommon um where a lot of your questions are positively um positively coded and then when some are negative included if you don’t make it clear in your wording when something is negatively coded you can get people to accidentally write the wrong answer and that’s excuse your entire thing and so if almost all your things are testing for positive and you go it makes me feel bad when blah blah and it’s not code it’s not written well enough that people can kind of just get in the habit of marking certain direction and then it can fail clear language avoid following jargon sling double barrelled questions um a double barrel a double barreled question is one in which people are answering two distinct questions with one final answer so do you like to do a and b or how how likely are you to do a and b one very unlikely five very likely if there’s a likelihood that they like to do a but not b so avoid these situations leading questions leading questions are super um easy to do and it’s really easy if you ever see bad surveys um especially in like political parties if you’re working with political parties who really want to get a certain answer um you can get this i think one of the ones that i hear complaining about a lot is anytime someone um almost any survey about medical for uh medicare for all um it’s really easy to have a leaning question in the direction that makes easier either um you can make it you can target someone to go hey don’t you think it’d be great if all um hospital bills were free oh yeah it’s easy to say yes go on the other side um do you want the government requiring you to get rid of all your of all your um all your choices and who you go to see for your doctors these are leading questions that you’re trying to build off of sentiment that exists and you’re not relying on fact i don’t want to get specifics about past surveys and those because it deals with political leanings um but what you happen here is you can it’s really easy to build these things um a lot of hot topics a lot hot button topics are doing that because you start to charge it with language um when you ask questions about is it okay to kill someone it makes it really easy to be against killing when you make it about um choice it’s a lot easier to be in favor of choice as a the vernacular makes a big thing so these leading questions um can start to skew the middle to provide inaccurate information um double negatives um we’re an english language speaking country for the most part um you’ll most likely be dealing with english language english language speaking respondents and so um what you want to make sure you avoid is the confusion of double negatives and so it’s really straightforward even though we use them in more um common parliaments it’s more important in these times to clearly state that um to never use a double negative even if the double negative is intended it confuses people so don’t do that overlapping or unbalanced questions be sure that if you’re trying to gauge sides of things or different elements of things that you’re making sure that you’re again not skewing things based on how things are phrased or this one allows a lot of weight this one doesn’t allow any weights make sure you’re trying to balance those things out um be sure to have exhaustive categories balance categories um exhaustive categories means that you’re allowing for every possibility to be explained um it’s not the easiest thing in some in some situations because it requires you to have a certain knowledge of everything um but it’s easy to kind of have some certain catch-alls um because it’s if something if you’re asking people to explain to basically present information about themselves and you’ve picked these like five pretty categories that explain most people you’ll have the people who fall outside of those who don’t know how to answer things and they’re really not any of them it’s one of the reasons why things like the kenzie scale has i believe it’s coded a um it’s basically a catch-all for saying they don’t they don’t follow along the classic um um sexuality spectrum they’re they exist on an outside spectrum that requires extra information and that’s one way to get to an exhaustive category categories without necessarily knowing all the answers are going into it and there’s really a balance category make sure things are presented um in such a way that you’re not that you’re that you don’t present one category the majority of responses the majority of cases and other ones have barely any it doesn’t provide you with much granular information if you’re only trying to find outliers okay key questions when you administer a survey who are the participants um when talking with any group of people um the type of questions you want the type of answers you want to get from them are important to be based on the demographics which is also why um survey methods almost all surveys include some level of demographic pool you want to know their age you want another race sometimes you don’t know the sexuality um orient their orientation um gender identity there’s certain things that you’d want to know because a lot of theories predict things based off of certain identifiers and so the better you know about the more you deal with the person the better it is in these survey situations which aren’t always possible in other classical research i do very little research where i know the age of my participants their gender their sexuality unless i’m working in distinct communities or with distinct tags like for when i work with twitter i can often pull pronouns it’s not a huge deal um but only for those who want to share pronouns how are you collecting the data are you collecting it where there’s inputting themselves are you inputting the data um are you um basically transposing these from from the paper documents however you’re collecting you want to make sure it’s a way that’s reliable and consistent um it’s really easy to mess up huge amounts of it’s really easy to mention but huge amounts of data based on the data input and based on as i said earlier when things aren’t clear enough not just with the questions but how to input those responses the last one is your survey a one shot or a longitudinal study it’s longitudinal design i think it’s a little more all-encompassing than it intends to be um but it’s important to look at one shot versus longitudinal one shot or cross sectional design click the surface at one point in time you know what the participants think only at one time and what we have here is that um let’s say this is this is one way to go after someone goes and watch a movie or after someone watches like a a political ad campaign um they watch the videos they come out and you get their sentiment about it this is a this is a one shot um design longitudinal respondents given the same questions over a period of time to track changes in perception traits or behaviors if changes occur researchers attribute changes to some variable within the study um and so i think the book grouping is as a two distinct types because it’s kind of the middle ground um for example you can pre-test post-test a one-shot so someone walks you you ask people questions about a political figure you show them ads you ask questions about the political figure again um that’s before and after that’s pre-processing but longitudinal by its definition is actually meant for things that happen over long periods of time this is really common in things like education um there’s been a lot of great work about the lives of geniuses um kids who grew up with high iqs and then tracking them their lives for 20 years so for 20 years you regularly take you you regularly conduct services with them about their life choices their families um their employment the things that they’re doing with friends the romantic relationships all these kinds of things and what you do is you hope to be able to find whenever things change and identify what variables leave that to be there um education is one that has people take different types of classes or do different learning experiences you don’t you don’t actually interject and um alter what they’re doing your entire job is to track it over time and then hopefully whenever large spot whatever there’s major changes across um demographics you start to see things and so when you’re able to identify oh these 30 people go up in this section what do these 30 people have in common and then you’ll be able to start to identify oh they made these people didn’t go to college or these people moved away from the city they were born in these are kind of things that with longitudinal studies you can start to identify oh these people had a kid these people lost a kid um that’s the kind of stuff that longitudinal studies helped me find is these over these long-term changes but you can do longitudinal studies you can do studies with this methodology on a lot shorter scale um i know a lot of education grants that basically try to look at education over a semester over an academic year and these wouldn’t necessarily be considered longitudinal studies but they bear a lot of the hallmarks of election longitudinal study analyzing survey data first four steps first check surveys for errors you want to know what if anything if people are answering these incorrectly um for example um do they mark two things as correct on a paper ballot um did it leave something empty um did they mark things that are distinctly um inconsistent um one of the ways this means is there’s a lot of questions that you’ll do in a survey where you’ll ask kind of the same question multiple times and it’s possible that um someone will have um march with this industry opposition everything else and that’s something you should be wary of um there’s a phrase that i’m missing in this recorded lecture show it’s um there are certain things called they’re not alertness tests um but there are prompts inside of a survey that you use to make sure they’re still paying attention so for example the survey requires reading and then they then they ask you about your opinions on things they’ll also ask you a question that’s a factual question based on what you just read so they can make sure that you’re actually reading what you’re asking being asked to read asked to read and moving on and so um gosh it’s been wrong service i can’t remember what’s called if anyone wants to know contact me i’ll know the second i finish recording this probably enter the data once you enter the data double check to make sure what you enter um it’s really easy data entry can kill an entire server a study especially if you’re dealing with um a small like a precise sample size what can happen is a couple misplaced um pieces of data can skew entire results and then once you’re there you can analyze your data but make sure that all your stuff is entered correctly otherwise you’ll be throwing out surveys unnecessarily advantages of surveys cost very low cost you don’t have to run your entire experiments um even if you’re running paper surveys you either have someone who’s already on the research team who they’re um wages are being covered by whatever the is being paid in the first place um you have people who are um if you’re doing it over qualtrics it’s a really easy way to send a whole bunch of send out a bunch of surveys um you can sit about to like whatever messages that there’s not the same cost associated with doing something like a focus group which gets a lot of people into the same room for an hour interviews which require a lot of people over a long time period of time being in the room these are all very quick methods which is also why speed um quantity of participants um for most even large large interviewers focus group projects you never get more than you rarely ever get more than like 100 people in this interview um if you’re in a larger research team you can have tens of thousands of survey respondents and that helps kind of weed out any um dirty or skewed data ability to distribute in a variety of places and methods um if you’re working for example i’m working on a research team um that we just submitted a grant um for the pi for the ps on pi’s on the grant we’re from five universities that gives us five networks of unit of colleges that we can separate these surveys out to and be able to get different demographics easily um outside of us there are two other people on the team um one state side one international who we can even distribute even further and so this makes it really easy to distribute out to wider populations um it also makes it easier that you that when doing like interviews and focus groups you tend to rely on inbuilt networks whereas when you’re trying to build which limits the kind of like the outliers of the demographics um whereas when you’re doing surveys it’s easier to get the outliers involved because you don’t have to actually have the personal time with them standardization of questions can lead to reliable results um interviews are great at getting answers and getting follow-ups and getting extra responses surveys are great at making sure that the same exact question is being asked the same exact people regardless of context and so what you do is you always get people reading the same question and you never have a survey giver skewing what that question means surveys can lead to more generalizable results one of the biggest things that’s important for research is external validity surveys allow you to because you remove a lot of the individual from the server from the research that you have you can find truly consistent external externally well validable results so people could have general so you have the general generalizability of these results so you can get kind of a broader picture of how things are happening limitations of surveys surveys are not focused on context one of the things that interviews allows you to do is when you’re asking a question making sure that everyone’s on the same page so if i’m talking about let’s say i’m doing a survey about content creators online and i ask people a question in a survey i have no idea whether that is going to be talking about their role as a content creator or life in general whereas in an interview if they start answering a question and no way how about this and lead them back more towards and give them the broader context for what i want the conversation to be about surveys are surveys are inflexible instruments if you find out part way through that there are major gaps in the things that you want to be studying then what the next step is is to scrap all the work you’ve done and consider it more of a pilot test and then restart your survey with new um new questions um a few more removed questions kind of building out a better survey you can’t just kind of adapt as it progresses as you could with a focus group or an interview surveys generally need a large number of participants to be reliable um because surveys in general are only as deep as you want them to be and can have very little breath um a lot of the extra information a lot of the actual like world building that happens with more qualitative research doesn’t happen with um with um surveys and because of that you also need people you also need people a whole bunch of people answering the same questions to kind of get to the same reliability that instead of going into just interviewing 20 people you have to survey 200 to start to get the same level certainly expectations reliability about the information being shared because you’re kind of guiding them through it um and then finally a possible social desirability bias people whether answering to your face or answering online are more likely to answer the question they feel is what’s socially expected of them so when you start to ask about sensitive topics um especially if they’re from groups that have expectations for them on these norms built into them they’re more likely to answer um in line with the social social norms in which they follow um this is more likely to be the case in face to face but despite all expectations it still exists on um online versions of things just to a lesser degree so i hope everyone has has been helpful to everyone if you have any questions
