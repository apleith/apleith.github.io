<p>Welcome to <em>Introduction to Communication and Media Research with R</em>. I am Alex P. Leith, an Assistant Professor in the Mass Communications department at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. While a doctoral student at Michigan State University, I fell in love with the flexibility of the R program for data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. My intention with this book is to build an introductory research book for communication and media professionals that are tasked with research. For college students, this text is intended for individuals with either zero or limited research experience.</p>
<p>This book is also a practice in applying generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) in writing drafts. Namely, the first draft of this paper is a mix of human and AI writing. As I continue to work on this book, I will clean the text until limited traces of AI remain. I am using AI (e.g., Chat GPT, Google Bard) to identify future uses of these tools that still allow for individual work and learning opportunities. This book also borrows structure from existing research methods books. Images are pulled from royalty-free locations, such as Unsplash and Wikimedia.</p>
<p>Communication research systematically studies the processes, antecedents, and consequences of communication. It is a broad field encompassing various topics, from interpersonal to mass communication. Media research is the study of the effects of mass media on society, culture, and individuals. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including the impact of media on news consumption, political attitudes, and consumer behavior. Communication and media researchers use various methods to collect data, including surveys, interviews, focus groups, and experiments.</p>

<h2>Interviews<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interviews"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Interviews are a research method in which the interviewer gathers information from the interviewee through open-ended questions and follow-up questions. The goal of a qualitative interview is to understand the interviewee’s experiences, perspectives, and beliefs on a particular topic. Qualitative interviews are often used in social science research, but they can also be used in other fields, such as business, healthcare, and education. They are a valuable tool for gathering in-depth information that cannot be easily obtained through other methods, such as surveys or questionnaires. Interviews can be a valuable tool for researchers who want to understand the experiences, perspectives, and beliefs of people on a particular topic. However, it is important to note that qualitative interviews are not without their challenges. They can be time-consuming and expensive to conduct, and the data can be difficult to analyze. Additionally, the interviewer’s own biases can influence the results of the interview.</p>

<p>Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, inform conclusions, and support decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under various names in different business, science, and social science domains. For our context, we are most interested in descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize data and describe its main features. They can be used to calculate measures of central tendency (such as the mean, median, and mode) and measures of variation (such as the standard deviation). Inferential statistics are used to make inferences about a population based on a sample. They can be used to test hypotheses and estimate parameters. The best type of data analysis for a particular dataset will depend on the specific research question being asked and the goals of the study. Choosing a data analysis method that is appropriate for the data and will help answer the research question is vital.</p>
