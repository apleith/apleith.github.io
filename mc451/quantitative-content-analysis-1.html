<p>hello class and welcome to chapter 13 content analysis quantitative this is a companion chapter chapter 12 quantum content analysis qualitative um in which we’ll kind of expound upon things that are explicit to um quantitative and also give backstory to general content analysis as i said these chapters 12 and 13 are meant to be companion pieces so here we’ll go into more of what is content analysis content analysis by definition is research techniques or for objective systematic and quantitative descriptions of manifest and latent content and so for in the case of quantum in the case of quantitative content analysis we’re looking at things is just just as like with qualitative we’re looking at systematic systems systematic procedures um and techniques and in this case we’re looking more things at things that are quantitative meaning the ultimate goal for quantitative content analysis is not building codes but counting these codes in the presence of these codes to identify comparisons and differentiations research tool for making replicable and valid inferences from data to a context one of the big weaknesses in general qualitative research is that you can’t make broader inferences based off your findings the use of quantitative content analysis is that you start to be able to make these claims because you’re building off of existing theories and you’re approaching a more statistical basis to provide more general inferences and external validity a way to analyze written verbal or visual communic communicative messages this is something that’s not distinct for quantitative but it’s important to recognize that um content analysis is generally important when working with things that can be considered just general content um the spoken word or just words in general is one of the greatest ones um but it’s not limited to what people say um early into my research um i was working with some colleagues with in speech therapy and art therapy who were looking at things like um individuals art projects to try to identify um balances and differentiations between things as when it comes to the messages that they’re attempting to send and so from there we weren’t looking at words we’re looking at the actual visual representation of people’s communication uh this method for gadget gathering and analyzing the conscious context of text um what we’ll find a lot of times um people will find a lot of different ways to say the same things and content is what you see that so you start to strip away a lot of the floweriness a lot of the um facade of language you start to break it down to its individual pieces and you start to find comparisons in place that you wouldn’t otherwise find which is one of the advantages of more qualitative or qualitative is that in qualitative it’s easier to fall prey to the to the flowery even though you will also find on the more precise content analysis history i think there’s two great um examples here to kind of show what content analysis looks like in the wild um the first one was a great one which is songs of zion which um deals with the swedish swedish church what they found is that um there’s a large number of people in the um early 1900s who the swedish church had a preset list of hymns and from these hymns there was 90 popular non-state sponsored songs and these songs as they grew in popularity members of the swedish church were starting to find these to be um blasphemous or sacrilegious and so they’re trying to get them banned so what content analysis allowed was it was able to break down all of the official hymns for the church of sweden and compare the content of these messages um and the symbolism in these hymns to the same to the um messages and symbolism in these 90 popular non-state sponsored songs and what they found was there was no meaningful difference between the official songs and the unofficial songs and as such could not be deemed as blasphemous and so they were able to be accepted because of this comparison that even though they’re not state sponsored the message and the symbology is the same or symbolism is the same and another example um is laszlo propaganda um during world war ii they were able to um the state was able to sponsor um example um examinations of propaganda to be able to identify both um the extent that propaganda was occurring to be able to identify between propaganda and non-propaganda but also to be able to identify its influence on public opinion and support consonants is another way in which that can be done content analysis categories um these are things that we’ve talked about before um but basically they’re important to be able to identify content categories areas themes groupings of categories or types with explicit boundaries into which data is coded um with qualitative that with qualitative content analysis um there’s a lot of looseness there because you’re building it as you work and so what happens is you start to operationalize these codes the more that you work with them by the time you’re doing quantitative content analysis is also this is even more important because what you need to do is be able to hand someone a set of rules and they need to be able to go through and code for those rules which means the boundaries are super important when you first create content categories deductive content analysis so these this is building out um when you create these codes first it’s deductive and then whenever you build them out without building first explicit categories is inductive inductive is more qualitative deductive is more quantitative so now we get to a coding schedule or sheet a sheet is where you track record or categorize what you are coding um what will also what will often happen in quantitative coding is you’ll have all your content and then you’ll have um co-researchers you’ll have what will need to happen is that someone will need to build out your schedule your schedule or sheet when you build this out it’s telling people specifically what to look for what to categorize and what to put together and so um what will then happen is you’ll need to you need to build this out in such a way that when person x versus x y and z all see this schedule or the sheet that they’re coding off of they should all be able to code the same things into the same categories if your sheet does not make that possible then it means you need to work rework your sheet it’s one of the reasons why it is recommended when building out one of these code books or code schedule or sheets that you first take a sub sample of your data that you won’t use in your full project and then run tests so it’s um it’s as well how you can train your code is how you train your code book that you give them a non you give them a part of the data that won’t be later used in the full project and then you test your code book off that then you come together as a group you work through it and go hey i mark this as this you mark it as that let’s figure out why we marked it differently so we can both train our coders and our book so that we can be on the same page so that whenever we finally sit down to do the full coding that all the coders are on the same page which also allows you to know that if you were to then hand this book off to a third party and they try to do it that it’d be easier for them to be on the same page as the coders because everyone along the way worked out common terms and common coding so that people can be um all together on it and on the last point for this is the idea of inner code reliability when you’re working with quantitative coding um you’re literally going through here’s the code with the code book that exists and you’re counting out presences of these codes um what we have here is we have four different versions of it cohen’s kappa spearman’s row pearson’s correlation and kipradorf’s alpha each of these are statistical tests to see how much your coders are in agreement it’s usually what you want to do is have it where you have coder pairs on a set of data and so even if you have six coders or four coders or 12 coders or seven coders what you want to do is make sure that codes are pairing up on pieces of data it could be that um your coders you can complicate these by having coders um match up with different people along the way we want to make sure there’s always two coders on data then what you can do is you can compare the [Music] um one code with the other code and you can get back um the intercoder liability score which is basically your um oh the terms this term’s escaping me um reliability your faith in accurate coding that the more they’re in unison and so if you go through the more that your coders are using the more likely you are to have an accurate code book and be coming to accurate findings um because then that way people you that way you should be able to expect anyone to use your code book to come out to the same findings um this is the one of the main differences for quantitative and one things that the book um doesn’t put a huge emphasis on is the key point between qualitative and quantitative is whether you’re coming in with a preset book and whether you’re attempting to make these these claims of validity of testing um with qualitative the most the closest you got was the summative and if somebody have gave you counts just like this one will give you count just like quantitatively accounts the difference is um summative will never will is not expecting you to draw statistically significant variants or comparisons between groups it’s meant to present the general findings as more descriptive statistics whereas um the way to work with quantitative is to build more towards the fact that these are accurate based off of internet code reliabilities and then um you could do some level of um comparison between means and that’s that’s basically you start to bring in more statistics because this one is quantitative if you have any questions please let me know and have a wonderful day</p>
