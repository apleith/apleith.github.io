um still mall goer believe guess um wouldn’t uncommon someone standing outside store one anchors go hey five minutes answer questions reliable thing undergrad um working people pr work um ’s important face face ask people questions surveys usually given distance one four ways face face take home mail phone paper-based surveys guess break kind distinct methods um times ’re hanging people surveys ’s helpful walk um one things ’s super important especially ’re mailing things sending things phone make sure easy way get back send send something mail likelihood mailing back don’t like prepaid um replies low kind things kind get eaten cost research web-based surveys presented collected entirely online data collected online um says ’re finding easier easier people fighting demographic demographics finding online least semi balance literacy semi least semi-literate online interactions ’s becoming easier easier get older people younger people involved surveys um website monkey um university uh used qualtrics pretty standard survey method used universities um lot large companies kind things walk kind first classic paper based versus web-based although book separates ’m huge fan separating classic ones paper based actual paper person different someone um read paper phone one advantage um face--face phone someone’s walking questions take home mail persons walking walking similar web-based pros cons um matter survey method choose cons um pros like one think one great things web base ’s easier easier people find time take five minute survey can get whatever want um whereas telephones can’t catch people phone right time people unlikely reschedule time call back ’re gonna call lot people difference example paper-based um people um ’re likely get people just agree help person however ’s con ’re also likely get someone lie face face especially ’re dealing something ’s either sensitive participant feels may sensitive things want weigh um think ’d beneficial something pressure someone talking feel like give easier chance um contradict obscure truth clear service super important clear instructions needed um ’re giving likert scale um make sure know five good five bad least five high something one five low something um ’re dealing metrics things make sure understand um first thing something’s ’s uncommon um lot questions positively um positively coded negative included don’t make clear wording something negatively coded can get people accidentally write wrong answer ’s excuse entire thing almost things testing positive go makes feel bad blah blah ’s code ’s written well enough people can kind just get habit marking certain direction can fail clear language avoid following jargon sling double barrelled questions um double barrel double barreled question one people answering two distinct questions one final answer like b likely b one unlikely five likely ’s likelihood like b avoid situations leading questions leading questions super um easy ’s really easy ever see bad surveys um especially like political parties ’re working political parties really want get certain answer um can get think one ones hear complaining lot anytime someone um almost survey medical uh medicare um ’s really easy leaning question direction makes easier either um can make can target someone go hey don’t think ’d great um hospital bills free oh yeah ’s easy say yes go side um want government requiring get rid um choices go see doctors leading questions ’re trying build sentiment exists ’re relying fact don’t want get specifics past surveys deals political leanings um happen can ’s really easy build things um lot hot topics lot hot button topics start charge language um ask questions okay kill someone makes really easy killing make um choice ’s lot easier favor choice vernacular makes big thing leading questions um can start skew middle provide inaccurate information um double negatives um ’re english language speaking country part um ’ll likely dealing english language english language speaking respondents um want make sure avoid confusion double negatives ’s really straightforward even though use um common parliaments ’s important times clearly state um never use double negative even double negative intended confuses people don’t overlapping unbalanced questions sure ’re trying gauge sides things different elements things ’re making sure ’re skewing things based things phrased one allows lot weight one doesn’t allow weights make sure ’re trying balance things um sure exhaustive categories balance categories um exhaustive categories means ’re allowing every possibility explained um ’s easiest thing situations requires certain knowledge everything um ’s easy kind certain catch-alls um ’s something ’re asking people explain basically present information ’ve picked like five pretty categories explain people ’ll people fall outside don’t know answer things ’re really ’s one reasons things like kenzie scale believe ’s coded um ’s basically catch-saying don’t don’t follow along classic um um sexuality spectrum ’re exist outside spectrum requires extra information ’s one way get exhaustive category categories without necessarily knowing answers going ’s really balance category make sure things presented um way ’re ’re don’t present one category majority responses majority cases ones barely doesn’t provide much granular information ’re trying find outliers okay key questions administer survey participants um talking group people um type questions want type answers want get important based demographics also um survey methods almost surveys include level demographic pool want know age want another race sometimes don’t know sexuality um orient orientation um gender identity ’s certain things ’d want know lot theories predict things based certain identifiers better know deal person better survey situations aren’t always possible classical research little research know age participants gender sexuality unless ’m working distinct communities distinct tags like work twitter can often pull pronouns ’s huge deal um want share pronouns collecting data collecting ’s inputting inputting data um um basically transposing paper documents however ’re collecting want make sure ’s way ’s reliable consistent um ’s really easy mess huge amounts ’s really easy mention huge amounts data based data input based said earlier things aren’t clear enough just questions input responses last one survey one shot longitudinal study ’s longitudinal design think ’s little -encompassing intends um ’s important look one shot versus longitudinal one shot cross sectional design click surface one point time know participants think one time um let’s say one way go someone goes watch movie someone watches like political ad campaign um watch videos come get sentiment one shot um design longitudinal respondents given questions period time track changes perception traits behaviors changes occur researchers attribute changes variable within study um think book grouping two distinct types ’s kind middle ground um example can pre-test post-test one-shot someone walks ask people questions political figure show ads ask questions political figure um ’s ’s pre-processing longitudinal definition actually meant things happen long periods time really common things like education um ’s lot great work lives geniuses um kids grew high iqs tracking lives 20 years 20 years regularly take regularly conduct services life choices families um employment things ’re friends romantic relationships kinds things hope able find whenever things change identify variables leave um education one people take different types classes different learning experiences don’t don’t actually interject um alter ’re entire job track time hopefully whenever large spot whatever ’s major changes across um demographics start see things ’re able identify oh 30 people go section 30 people common ’ll able start identify oh made people didn’t go college people moved away city born kind things longitudinal studies can start identify oh people kid people lost kid um ’s kind stuff longitudinal studies helped find long-term changes can longitudinal studies can studies methodology lot shorter scale um know lot education grants basically try look education semester academic year wouldn’t necessarily considered longitudinal studies bear lot hallmarks election longitudinal study analyzing survey data first four steps first check surveys errors want know anything people answering incorrectly um example um mark two things correct paper ballot um leave something empty um mark things distinctly um inconsistent um one ways means ’s lot questions ’ll survey ’ll ask kind question multiple times ’s possible um someone um march industry opposition everything else ’s something wary um ’s phrase ’m missing recorded lecture show ’s um certain things called ’re alertness tests um prompts inside survey use make sure ’re still paying attention example survey requires reading ask opinions things ’ll also ask question ’s factual question based just read can make sure ’re actually reading ’re asking asked read asked read moving um gosh ’s wrong service can’t remember ’s called anyone wants know contact ’ll know second finish recording probably enter data enter data double check make sure enter um ’s really easy data entry can kill entire server study especially ’re dealing um small like precise sample size can happen couple misplaced um pieces data can skew entire results ’re can analyze data make sure stuff entered correctly otherwise ’ll throwing surveys unnecessarily advantages surveys cost low cost don’t run entire experiments um even ’re running paper surveys either someone ’s already research team ’re um wages covered whatever paid first place um people um ’re qualtrics ’s really easy way send whole bunch send bunch surveys um can sit like whatever messages ’s cost associated something like focus group gets lot people room hour interviews require lot people long time period time room quick methods also speed um quantity participants um even large large interviewers focus group projects never get rarely ever get like 100 people interview um ’re larger research team can tens thousands survey respondents helps kind weed um dirty skewed data ability distribute variety places methods um ’re working example ’m working research team um just submitted grant um pi ps pi’s grant ’re five universities gives us five networks unit colleges can separate surveys able get different demographics easily um outside us two people team um one state side one international can even distribute even makes really easy distribute wider populations um also makes easier like interviews focus groups tend rely inbuilt networks whereas ’re trying build limits kind like outliers demographics um whereas ’re surveys ’s easier get outliers involved don’t actually personal time standardization questions can lead reliable results um interviews great getting answers getting follow-ups getting extra responses surveys great making sure exact question asked exact people regardless context always get people reading question never survey giver skewing question means surveys can lead generalizable results one biggest things ’s important research external validity surveys allow remove lot individual server research can find truly consistent external externally well validable results people general general generalizability results can get kind broader picture things happening limitations surveys surveys focused context one things interviews allows ’re asking question making sure everyone’s page ’m talking let’s say ’m survey content creators online ask people question survey idea whether going talking role content creator life general whereas interview start answering question way lead back towards give broader context want conversation surveys surveys inflexible instruments find part way major gaps things want studying next step scrap work ’ve done consider pilot test restart survey new um new questions um removed questions kind building better survey can’t just kind adapt progresses focus group interview surveys generally need large number participants reliable um surveys general deep want can little breath um lot extra information lot actual like world building happens qualitative research doesn’t happen um um surveys also need people also need people whole bunch people answering questions kind get reliability instead going just interviewing 20 people survey 200 start get level certainly expectations reliability information shared ’re kind guiding um finally possible social desirability bias people whether answering face answering online likely answer question feel ’s socially expected start ask sensitive topics um especially ’re groups expectations norms built ’re likely answer um line social social norms follow um likely case face face despite expectations still exists um online versions things just lesser degree hope everyone helpful everyone questions please feel free contact earliest
