# Inferential Analysis

## Regression Analysis {.unnumbered}
- **Introduction to Regression Analysis**: This section would start by defining regression analysis, a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The relevance of regression analysis in the context of social media data would be highlighted, such as understanding how different factors influence user engagement or content popularity.
- **Types of Regression Models**: Detailed discussion on various types of regression models applicable in social media contexts, including linear regression, logistic regression, and multiple regression. Each model type would be explained with its specific use cases, such as using logistic regression for binary outcomes like likes/dislikes.
- **Implementation in Social Media Data**: Step-by-step guide on how to implement regression analysis on social media data, including data preparation, model selection, fitting the model, and interpreting the results. Real-world examples, like predicting the number of shares based on post characteristics, would be provided for clarity.
- **Assumptions and Limitations**: Addressing the assumptions underlying regression models and discussing the limitations and potential pitfalls when applying these models to social media data, like issues of multicollinearity or overfitting.

## t-Test {.unnumbered}
- **Understanding t-Tests**: Introducing the t-test as a statistical hypothesis test used to compare the means of two groups. The section would explain the importance of t-tests in social media analytics, such as comparing user engagement before and after a specific campaign.
- **Types of t-Tests**: Explaining different types of t-tests including independent samples t-test and paired samples t-test, and when to use each type in the context of social media data analysis.
- **Conducting t-Tests on Social Media Data**: A practical guide on performing t-tests on social media data, including setting up the hypothesis, checking for assumptions (like normality and homogeneity of variance), performing the test, and interpreting the results.
- **Examples and Case Studies**: Illustrative examples and case studies where t-tests have been used to make informed decisions in social media strategy, such as evaluating the effectiveness of different types of post content.

## ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) {.unnumbered}
- **Basics of ANOVA**: This section would explain ANOVA as a technique used to compare means across more than two groups or conditions. The applicability of ANOVA in social media analytics, like comparing engagement across multiple social media platforms, would be emphasized.
- **One-way and Two-way ANOVA**: Discussion on different types of ANOVA, mainly one-way ANOVA for one independent variable and two-way ANOVA for two independent variables. Each type's application in social media contexts would be covered.
- **Implementing ANOVA in Social Media Data Analysis**: Guidance on how to conduct ANOVA, including checking assumptions, performing the test using software like R or Python, and interpreting the results. Practical examples could include analyzing the impact of different posting times on user engagement.
- **Post Hoc Analysis**: Introducing the concept of post hoc analysis in ANOVA when significant differences are found, to determine which specific groups differ from each other.

## Chi-Square Tests {.unnumbered}
- **Introduction to Chi-Square Tests**: Defining chi-square tests and explaining their purpose in testing the association between two categorical variables. The section would cover the significance of chi-square tests in analyzing social media data, such as examining the relationship between user demographics and content preferences.
- **Conducting Chi-Square Tests**: Detailed instructions on how to perform chi-square tests on social media data, including setting up the hypothesis, constructing contingency tables, performing the test, and interpreting the results.
- **Assumptions and Considerations**: Discussing the key assumptions behind chi-square tests, such as the expectation of frequency distribution, and how to deal with potential issues like small expected frequencies.
- **Real-World Applications**: Providing examples of how chi-square tests have been used in social media research, like studying the association between types of social media platforms and specific user behaviors or preferences.
