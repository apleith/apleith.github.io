<li><p><strong>Respect for Persons:</strong> This principle acknowledges the intrinsic worth of all individuals, affirming their right to make autonomous decisions. It emphasizes the necessity of obtaining informed consent from research participants, ensuring they are fully aware of and agree to the research procedures and any associated risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Beneficence:</strong> Beneficence entails an obligation on the part of researchers to maximize benefits and minimize harm to participants. This principle requires a careful assessment of the risks and benefits associated with the research, striving to protect participants from harm while contributing valuable knowledge to society.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Justice:</strong> The principle of justice demands equitable distribution of the benefits and burdens of research. It ensures that no segment of the population is unfairly burdened with the risks of research or unjustly excluded from its benefits. This principle advocates for fairness in participant selection, ensuring that the research reflects the diversity of the society it aims to serve.</p></li>
