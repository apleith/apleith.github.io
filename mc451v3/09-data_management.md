# Data Management in R {.unnumbered}

This chapter will provide essential knowledge and skills for effective data management in R, a critical component of quantitative research in mass communications. It will cover the entire process from importing data into RStudio to preparing the dataset for analysis, ensuring students are well-equipped to handle real-world data challenges in their research projects.

## Importing Data into RStudio {.unnumbered}

### Supported File Types and Import Methods {.unnumbered}

- Comprehensive overview of the different types of data files that can be imported into R, such as CSV, Excel, SPSS, and JSON files. Discussion on the particularities and common use cases of each file type in mass communication research.

- Step-by-step instructions on how to import these various file types into R using both code (e.g., `read.csv`, `read_excel`, `read.spss`) and RStudio's graphical interface.

- Tips for troubleshooting common issues encountered during data import, such as dealing with different character encodings or incorrect data formats.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation {.unnumbered}

### Handling Missing Values and Outliers {.unnumbered}

- Explanation of the significance of missing values in quantitative research and the impact they can have on analysis results. Discussion of different types of missing data (completely at random, at random, not at random).

- Techniques for handling missing values, including imputation methods and the use of R functions like `na.omit` and packages like `mice`.

- Identification and treatment of outliers: methods for detecting outliers (e.g., boxplots, standard deviation), and strategies for dealing with them, such as transformation or removal, depending on the research context.

### Data Transformation Techniques {.unnumbered}

- Overview of common data transformation techniques necessary for preparing data for analysis, such as normalization, standardization, and categorization.

- Guidance on reshaping data: converting data between wide and long formats using functions like `melt` and `cast` from the `reshape2` package, or `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider` from the `tidyr` package.

- Best practices for creating derived variables and aggregating data, demonstrating how to use R's vectorized operations and functions like `dplyr`'s `mutate` and `summarise` for efficient data manipulation.
