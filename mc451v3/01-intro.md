# Introduction to Mass Communication Research and Ethics

This chapter will set the foundation for understanding mass communication research within a historical, methodological, and ethical context, establishing the groundwork for the deeper exploration of quantitative methods and practical applications in subsequent chapters.

## Overview of Mass Communication Research {.unnumbered}

### Historical Context and Evolution {.unnumbered}

- Tracing the roots of mass communication research to the early 20th century.

- Evolution from traditional media (print, radio, TV) to digital and social media.

## Research Methodologies {.unnumbered}

### Quantitative vs. Qualitative Methods {.unnumbered}

- Quantitative: Emphasizing on numerical data, statistical analysis, and objective measurement. Examples include surveys and content analysis.

- Qualitative: Focusing on in-depth understanding of media phenomena, often through interviews, focus groups, and ethnography.

### Mixed Methods Approach {.unnumbered}

- Integration of quantitative and qualitative methods to gain a comprehensive understanding of research questions.

- Discussion of how mixed methods can enrich media research by combining numerical data with rich, contextual insights.

## Introduction to Research Ethics {.unnumbered}

### Importance of Ethical Considerations {.unnumbered}

- Ethical research as a cornerstone of academic integrity and scientific validity.

- Discussion of the impact of unethical research on public trust and policy-making.

### Overview of Ethical Issues in Mass Communication Research {.unnumbered}

- Ethical challenges specific to mass communication, like privacy concerns, manipulation of information, and consent in the digital age.

- Case studies illustrating ethical dilemmas in media research.

## Institutional Review Board (IRB) Processes {.unnumbered}

### Purpose and Function {.unnumbered}

- The role of the IRB in protecting the rights and welfare of human subjects.
