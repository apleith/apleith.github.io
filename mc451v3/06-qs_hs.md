# Formulating Research Questions and Hypotheses {.unnumbered}

This chapter aims to equip students with the skills necessary to formulate effective research questions and hypotheses. It will provide a foundation for developing clear, relevant, and researchable questions, along with well-constructed hypotheses that are integral to quantitative research in mass communications. The chapter will use examples and exercises to illustrate these processes, ensuring students can apply these skills in their research endeavors.

## Developing Research Questions {.unnumbered}

### Characteristics of Good Research Questions {.unnumbered}

- Description of the essential attributes of a well-crafted research question: clarity, specificity, relevance, and feasibility. Emphasis on the importance of a question being answerable through empirical research.

- Discussion of how a research question should align with the overall objectives of the study and contribute to the field of mass communications.

- Illustration of how research questions can be both innovative, exploring new areas or angles, and grounded in existing literature.

### Techniques for Formulating Questions {.unnumbered}

- Step-by-step process for developing research questions, starting from a broad topic area and narrowing down based on literature gaps, theoretical frameworks, and practical considerations.

- Tools and methods such as brainstorming, mind mapping, and the use of research question frameworks (e.g., PICO - Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome).

- Examples of how to refine and revise research questions in response to preliminary research findings, feedback, and evolving understanding of the topic.

## Constructing Hypotheses {.unnumbered}

### Hypothesis Development Based on Literature {.unnumbered}

- Guidance on forming hypotheses that are informed by existing research and theoretical considerations. Discussion on how hypotheses are used to test theories or to investigate specific aspects of media phenomena.

- Explanation of the iterative process of hypothesis development, including reviewing literature, identifying gaps or inconsistencies, and formulating a hypothesis that addresses these.

### Types of Hypotheses: Null, Alternative {.unnumbered}

- Definition and role of the null hypothesis (H0) as a statement of no effect or no difference, used as a basis for statistical testing.

- Explanation of the alternative hypothesis (H1), which posits the existence of an effect or a relationship, and how it contrasts with the null hypothesis.

- Examples of null and alternative hypotheses in mass communications research, including both directional and non-directional hypotheses.

- Discussion of the importance of hypotheses in quantitative research, particularly in guiding the research design and statistical analysis.
